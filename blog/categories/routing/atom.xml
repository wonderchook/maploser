    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I received notification from Google today that I was right. Â We'll see when the update actually occurs:</p>

<p>Hi Kate,
Your Google Maps problem report has been reviewed, and you were right! We'll update the map within a month and email you when you can see the change.</p>

<p><em>Report history
Problem ID: 0xbca26e97c9d22b08</em></p>

<p>_ _</p>

<p><em>Your report:</em> It does not appear that you have White's Ferry available for routing. Between Leesburg,VA and Martinsburg, MD this is the most direct and fastest route.</p>

<p>--
Thanks for your help,
The Google Maps team</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent some time look around Google Maps since they stopped using Teleatlas in the United States this week. Â Essentially I poked around looking for errors that are usually in the street vendor data. Â Mostly these are minor errors such as a single line segment misspelled. Â  The problems usually appear to have originated with the original <a href="http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/">TIGER</a> street data and never been repaired.</p>

<p>For the areas I'm familiar with the data looks good. Â There has been lots of conjecture as to where all the data was sourced. Â I suspect at least in L<a href="http://www.loudoun.gov/">oudoun County</a> where I live the source is the local government, that is unless the occasional segment errors were fixed by Google. Â The one error I did find was an edge case within the routing.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White's_Ferry">White's Ferry</a> is a small ferry line just north of Leesburg, Virginia. Â White's Ferry is supposed to be the late cable operated ferry on the East Coast, for a little historic background and to see it in action <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.tv/Clip.aspx?key=88A4A0F712356205">Lonely Planet </a>has a good video clip. Â It is the fastest way across the Potomac to rural Maryland on the otherside. Â When I lived in Leesburg I occasionally used it when traveling to suburban Maryland such as Rockville because it took the same amount of time and didn't require any driving on the Beltway. Â I'm fairly sure that previously if you routed it would take you across White's Ferry. Â I ran the route through a couple routing websites to compare results.</p>

<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?daddr=Leesburg,+VA&amp;geocode=Cf60Ojnhi4TLFY7bVAIdL3lg-w&amp;dirflg=&amp;saddr=Martinsburg,+mD&amp;f=d&amp;sll=39.138449,-77.533092&amp;sspn=0.073229,0.143509&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=11">On Google</a> it takes you up and around across a more northern bridge which is a much slower route in this situation. Â <a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?v=2&amp;FORM=LMLTCP&amp;cp=39.140241~-77.521509&amp;style=r&amp;lvl=13&amp;tilt=-90&amp;dir=0&amp;alt=-1000&amp;phx=0&amp;phy=0&amp;phscl=1&amp;rtp=pos.39.1156700536566_-77.5653001063996_Leesburg%2C%20VA__~pos.39.1646404240942_-77.4777188717115_Martinsburg%2C%20MD__&amp;rtop=0~0~0&amp;encType=1">Bing Maps</a> routes through the ferry, as does <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/mq/9-zOU3Tf0sSbXnO_D2">MapQuest</a>. Â <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&amp;lat=39.195525&amp;lon=-77.494765&amp;zoom=12&amp;q1=Leesburg%2C%20VA&amp;q2=Martinsburg%2C%20MD">Yahoo</a> goes up and around across the bridge the same way Google does. Â Potentially Yahoo could be a routing engine problem because their tiles say they are sourcing <a href="http://www.navteq.com/">NAVTEQ</a> data and on NAVTEQ's site you can successfully route from Leesburg to Martinsburg across the ferry (note: Â I could not figure out an easy way to link directly to the NAVTEQ route here).</p>

<p>I checked other ferry lines and it appears Google can do the multi-modal routing, but the ferry information is just missing for White's Ferry. Â As an experiment I have reported the missing ferry and requested notification when it is fixed. Â You can be sure that I'll report back here when I get a response.</p>

<p>While performing this exercise I checked OpenStreetMap to make sure the ferry was already available on <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=39.15324&amp;lon=-77.51475&amp;zoom=15&amp;layers=B000FTF">the map there</a>. Â Routing doesn't work so well in the routing service I used it took an even longer route to go been <a href="http://yournavigation.org/?flat=39.115667&amp;flon=-77.564144&amp;tlat=39.160803&amp;tlon=-77.513161&amp;v=motorcar&amp;fast=1&amp;layer=mapnik">Leesburg and Martinsburg</a>. At least with YourNavigation.org you can export the route data to GPX and use it in whatever device you like. Â If I'm going to use my local knowledge to repair map data I want it back to use however I like. Â You can report bugs in the Google map data, but you can't export it to GPX like you can with the OpenStreetMap data.</p>
