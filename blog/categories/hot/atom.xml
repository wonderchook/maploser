    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week is the first expert meeting regarding Space Based Technology and Crowd-Sourcing being hosted by UN-SPIDER.  I am not attending, but from the Twitter stream (#spidercrowd) it appears there has been a lively discussion on using satellite information and crowd-sourcing for disaster response.  What I believe is often missing from these types of conversations is preparedness.  Maybe it is presumptuous of me to discuss preparedness when imagery isn't available freely every time for every disaster.</p>

<p>I'm typing this email from Padang, Indonesia in Western Sumatra.  Yesterday I hosted a workshop at the <a href="http://www.unand.ac.id/">University of Andalas</a> to teach them about OpenStreetMap as part of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team's project in Indonesia.  This is the fifth workshop I've done at a University in Indonesia. Things went well, much like all of the other workshops I've given.  Students were excited and picked up the tools very quickly.  The one difference?  Available imagery.</p>

<p>This region of Indonesia is especially vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis, the last major earthquake in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Sumatra_earthquakes">Padang was in 2009</a>.  In preparing for this workshop series I investigated each area we were going to be working to check for available imagery.  For those not familiar OpenStreetMap is allowed to use Bing's imagery to trace information, this is one of the major sources of imagery for OpenStreetMap.  In checking I looked at Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta and Surabaya.  All four of these cities had really night, half-meter or so imagery.  In Padang?  It appears to just be Landsat.  I think this highlights the need for imagery to be available beforehand though.  If something major happened here I think it is likely imagery would become freely available.  Though creating a detailed map through crowd-sourcing?  That would take a week or two and be a huge effort from people that don't know the area as well as locals.  So why not map ahead of time?  Imagine the power if after an event the map just had to be updated, instead of created?</p>

<p>There are many different ways imagery could be made available.  Providers could donate it, I'm not asking for the shot the day before, fancy brand new imagery.  What about imagery that is a year old or so?  People purchasing imagery are usually looking for something more recent, the older stuff isn't as valuable.  An imagery fund could be created for preparedness.  What about doing a highschool style fundraiser where everyone purchases and adopts a square kilometer?  When purchasing imagery those doing the purchasing could negotiate for better terms on it.  For example sometimes you can add additional licensees without increasing the cost.  What if everyone purchasing imagery at least asked if they could license the imagery also for OpenStreetMap to use to trace vectors?  Or an even more liberal license if possible.</p>

<p>I'm interested to hear what others think about this and if there are other ideas.  Also don't worry specifically about HOT's project in Padang, we were fortunate to be able to purchase imagery.  As I suggested about licensing above, we also made sure to extend the license to the government and our partners.</p>

    <id>http://maploser.com/blog/2011/06/27/off-to-join-the-circus</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well not really off to join the circus, most of you probably already know about my employment change. I'm now working for the <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a>.  I always referred to working on OpenStreetMap projects full-time as "running off to join the OpenStreetMap."   That isn't to say people haven't done it previous, I think it is just is something many would love to do and few have figured out how to.  Much like joining the circus, though you trade in your clown nose for a GPS.  Or at least it can take a bit of a leap of faith in someways.</p>

<p>Anyway I ended my full-time employment at GeoIQ on May 16th and began transitioning over to working for HOT.   I loved working for GeoIQ, my coworkers were wonderful and I really believe in the technology that was being built.  However last year after going to Haiti and working remotely on other projects HOT was helping on, I really found a calling.  Working on things for HOT is yet to have felt like work and I hope it never does.  After the transitioning my real first day of only working for HOT was about June 15th.  That day I attended a meeting in New York City with other members from the Volunteer Technical Communities and the United Nations (OCHA to be specific).  I thought this was a good kick-off to my new position, because it is one of my goals for myself.  To be able to help coordinate with large organizations and other tech response groups so we can all be more effective.   I also hope to do some fundraising for HOT so we can coordinate better when disasters do happen.  There is a need to have infrastructure, software to better assist with mapping as well as individuals to help coordinate.  This items don't always translate into the need for funding, but I think there are going to be situations where it will.</p>

<p>A couple days later that week I switched to the other role I want to play as well.  Coordinate projects and doing field work when possible.  On June 17th I left the United States to return to Indonesia.  Here I'm working on a pilot project to use OpenStreetMap to help collect information to be fed into risk models.  Myself and Jeff Haack are here and mainly focused on giving workshops on using OpenStreetMap, setting up simple tools to allow people to use the data and coordinate between the interested organizations.  At the end of the three months we'll look at how things went and determine with our partners if the pilot can turn into a project for all of Indonesia.  Saying all of Indonesia sounds scary, since it is 17,000 islands and many diverse people.  Though so far everyone we've worked with has been enthusiastic and quick to pick-up the tools as well, so I'm excited to see if it can work.  I think if things keep going the way they have so far it will.</p>

<p>So I will be in Indonesia until mid-August, but after that I'll be a bit all over the place.  If I happen to coincide with where you are maybe we can meet-up.  As always the best way to keep up with me is on <a href="http://twitter.com/wonderchook">Twitter</a> and hopefully I'll keep up the <a href="http://twitter.com/hotosm">HOT Twitter Account</a> better as well.</p>

    <link href="http://maploser.com/blog/2011/03/29/disaster-2-0-innovation-in-the-disaster-response-space/"/>
    <updated>2011-03-29T03:23:12+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://maploser.com/blog/2011/03/29/disaster-2-0-innovation-in-the-disaster-response-space</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today the United Nations released their report "Disaster Relief 2.0: The Future of Information Sharing in Humanitarian Emergencies." Â Two members of the <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a> were interviewed for this report, myself and Nicolas Chavent. Â  Also of course many other from friend and partner organizations were interviewed as well.</p>

<p>For anyone interested in open data or new methods of crisis response I recommend you read the <a href="http://issuu.com/unfoundation/docs/disaster_relief20_report">whole report</a>. Â For others, well a seventy-two page report might seem like a bit much so what might be key is the <a href="http://www.unfoundation.org/assets/pdf/disaster-relief-2-findings-1.pdf">recommendations</a>. Â Key is the idea that information communities (called V&amp;TC in the report) came together after the earthquake in Haiti to help. Â Much of this revolved around the sharing and collection of data. Â The value of this type of activity to make a difference was clearly shown. Â The real question though is how do you make this happen again? Â And how can this fit into a framework that makes sense from the perspective of the large organizations as well as the informal communities.</p>

<p>The recommendations suggest a method so that the V&amp;TCs and the traditional humanitarian system can work together.  This includes 5 parts:</p>

<p>"1. A neutral forum to surface areas of agreement and conflict between international humanitarian system and the V&amp;TCs.
2. An innovation space where new tools and practices can be explored as experiments, allowing for the failures that are a necessary component of learning new ways of working.
3. A deployable field team with a mandate to deploy the best available tools and practices from the V&amp;TCs to the field.
4. A research and training consortium to evaluate the work in the field and to train humanitarians and V&amp;TCs alike in the best practices for information management in a humanitarian context.
5. A clear operational interface that outlines ways of collaborating before and during emergencies, with agreed procedures for communication, shared standards for data exchange and an understanding of roles, priorities and capabilities"</p>

<p>One of the key differences between technologists experimenting within the humanitarian response space versus a traditional technology start-up is the cost of failure. Â Remember in the early days of Â Twitter when things went down all the time? Â Or other technologies that didn't work quite right? Â Well, usually the risk is to shareholders, in crisis response this failure can translate to lives. Â  Â Hence the recommendation of a neutral space, an experimental zone, a deployment team and a way to communicate successes and failures back. Â In some ways this is taking what people were already doing in informal ways and giving it formal pathways.</p>

<p>I think much as new technologies replace old in the start-up space there will still be innovation from outside within the crisis response space. Â If the innovation space is working in anÂ optimumÂ setting it will be able to operationalize these techniques coming up outside the formal structures. Â Though I suspect some will still slip through, since when there is an emergency people will use what is simple, they know and what works. Â No matter what I think if these recommendations are adopted it will be a step forward in bringing the formal and informal groups together.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was putting together some really quick editing stats about Japan post earthquake/tsunami. Â I realized I should probably share them with the larger community rather than keep them to myself.</p>

<p>218 different individuals have editing in Japan in OpenStreetMap. Â Those editors have edited 389,431 nodes (this includes adding/removing/changing) . Â This has all happened through 1,409 editing sessions.</p>

<p>Keep it up everyone!</p>

<p>(Update) Some more details.</p>

<p>bbox = ((42.13, 133.45), (32.81, 142.57))</p>

<p>Starting at 00:00 2011-03-10 going to 03:00 2011-03-16.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in the beginning of October I attended the <a href="http://www.crisismappers.net/page/iccm-2010-haiti-and-beyond">International Conference on Crisis Mapping</a>.  The first day of the event was open to the public and included many ignite talks on a variety of topics related to crisis response.  I gave a talk titled "Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team in Haiti: from Crisis to Capacity Building."  I highlighted how HOT has been working to transfer the maintenance of the Haiti portion of the map to Haiti as well as some ways the data is currently being used.</p>
