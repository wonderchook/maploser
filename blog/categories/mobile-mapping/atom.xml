    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm somewhat interested to see what comes out of <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashcs5/appsfor_iphone/">Adobe's announcement</a> this week of the ability to build iPhone applications with ActionScript. Â This isn't actual Flash support on the iPhone but somewhat intriguing anyway. Â There are many businesses that utilize Flash for the mapping portion of their site such as <a href="http://www.umapper.com/">UMapper</a> and my employer's site <a href="http://www.geocommons.com">GeoCommons</a>, Google Maps even has a <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/flash/">Flash API</a>. Â My favorite project that utilizes Flash isÂ <a href="http://www.cartogrammar.com/flash/piano/Piano.html">Ohio is a Piano</a>.</p>

<p>By allowing developers to write applications in ActionScript will allow those already mapping in Flash today to build iPhone Apps more quickly and easily. Â Potentially those developers may have already existing components they can now utilize in their iPhone applications as well.</p>

<p>I will be interested to see how well compiling ActionScript down to native iPhone code works, but I believe we will see increased compelling iPhone mapping applications to come with this new option.</p>
