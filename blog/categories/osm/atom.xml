    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I heard DevelopmentSeed put in a proposal for the Knight News Challenge to make <a href="http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/19450699629/new-contribution-tools-for-openstreetmap">simple contribution tools for OpenStreetMap</a> I was elated. I've long admired DevSeed for their beautiful maps and innovative uses of new technology. Â They are already well involved in OpenStreetMap through support of Mapnik, attendance at development sprints and use of OpenStreetMap information in MapBox. I think there is a real opportunity here to improve the ability of average people to contribute to and utilize OpenStreetMap. Â What is the key? Â Make the tools simple and the cycle to use the data just as easy as contributing.</p>

<p>The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team probably spends more time than any other group in OpenStreetMap teaching the technology to non-technical users. Our work in Haiti and Indonesia has been with local people who are not programmers, nor GIS analysts. It can be a real struggle to ensure people can both enter data easily as well as utilize the information they have input. There are many great tools that help with this process, but it is far from smooth. Let's look at the entire OpenStreetMap contribution cycle.</p>

<h2>Gathering Data</h2>

<p>I would say collecting data in the field is probably the easiest part of OpenStreetMap. Â GPS units are relatively easy to use for example. Â The menus on the Garmin Etrex units that HOT usually use do have some odd menus, but for the most part people are just pushing the button to mark a way point. Â Though if I take a break from collecting data for a couple weeks I can never seem to find the menu item to delete those way points. Â This problem is not too difficult though and most people get used to the workflow.</p>

<p>Walking Papers by far is the biggest improvement in field data collection in years. Â My first job in mapping was creating field maps for mosquito control technicians. Â If I had Walking Papers back then it would have been magical. I was constantly getting paper maps back with corrections on them, it is just natural for people to draw on maps to denote new features. I think in data collection OpenStreetMap is in a good place, the real areas for improvement are editing and data usage.</p>

<h2>Entering Data</h2>

<p>I mean no slight to the developers of OpenStreetMap editing tools with my critique here. Potlatch2 and JOSM are both tools that I frequently use, but I am a programmer with a Geography Degree. Â How many people with my background are there on earth? Â By percentage probably not many.</p>

<p>The biggest flaw with either of these tools is they try to allow you to do everything. Â Most people however don't need to do everything. In an average workshop that I lead key goals are to map roads, add some points of interest and map houses. We never touch relations, I don't explain what a changeset is and someone help us if there is a conflict (which there always is). Â Usually we are using JOSM, Potlatch2 has come a long way in helping make the data entry process easier. Â Dragging icons over to the map to add them is far more natural than drawing an object and then clicking through a menu to define it as is done in JOSM.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.maploser.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Selection_012.png"><img src="http://www.maploser.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Selection_012-152x300.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Though the simple and advanced mode in Potlatch2 is a bit confusing and if you want to get the history of an item it is hard to find the right button. For example on the left is the advanced screen, can you guess where you would click to get the history of the selected item? Did you guess 30176850? Probably not. I think it is fair to say that looking at the object history is an advanced task, I don't often go over it in the first workshop unless the hands on portion leads us there. Â I don't think however that it is obvious to click on the unique identifier to go to that page.</p>

<p>One other minor complaint would be that some of the buttons "look more button like." It isn't completely clear here to tab between the Simple and Advanced screens for example and to delete a tag you click on an "x" button but to add you click on the word "Add." Using icons would make this more usable for those that don't have a version of Potlatch2 translated into their native language.</p>

<p>Overall I really like how Potlatch2 has made editing much more simple. Â If it worked offline we would consider teaching it instead of JOSM to beginners. It is a huge improvement over Potlatch2 and the team developing it has much to be proud. I think however there are ways to get even more simple.</p>

<h2></h2>

<h2>Using Data</h2>

<p>The biggest gap in OpenStreetMap is using the data. HOT has attempted to bridge that by teachingÂ <a href="http://qgis.org/">QuantumÂ GIS</a>, which has made huge strides in the past year in becoming an easy to use complete Desktop GIS. Â That is just it though, you shouldn't have to use Desktop GIS just to make a map. <a href="http://mapbox.com">MapBox</a> has greatly improved the accessibility of making web maps, but sometimes you just want to print. Speeding up the cycle of data usage would also assist. Â The most frequent way we suggest people access the data is to download it from <a href="http://download.geofabrik.de/">GeoFabrik</a>, which is a great free service. The only thing lacking is speed, there is great joy in adding information and seeing it show up on the OpenStreetMap website virtually instantly, but some disappointment when you have to wait a day to be able to use it in specifically the way you want. There are ways to get around this, but they do require someone technical to set them up.</p>

<h2>Simple Language</h2>

<p>Normally when I post publicly about OpenStreetMap I make it a point to try to avoid the language of OpenStreetMap. It is a language people can use but is not immediately accessible to most people. My favorite example of obscure language in tools is when my interns <a href="http://whateverisaid.wordpress.com/">Emir Hartato</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/justva">Vasanthi</a> were translating JOSM into Bahasa Indonesia and got to "OrthogonalizeÂ Shape." Think about it, does the average person know what that means? Â What about using language like straighten corners or something? By the way "Orthogonalize Shape" is "Ortogonalisasi Bentuk" in Bahasa Indonesia in case you were wondering.</p>

<h2>What Do I Want?</h2>

<p>So far I've pointed on flaws in OpenStreetMap, but what is my point? What do I really want? Â Simple tools and simple language for the average person. If a person fluent in two languages has to stop and really think about how to translate something, then it is probably too complicated. Let's concentrate on making work flows for the 90% of use cases that utilize the 10% of existing functionality, not try to cover every piece of possible functionality.</p>

<p>Rather than thinking about tasks by functions let's think about them by themes. Â Groups that are interested in mapping for disaster preparedness, groups that want to map the green spaces in their community, people that want to share a great hiking route with everyone. Â In starting with the use-cases the needed functionality will become obvious.</p>

<p>More than anything, let's make sure when someone puts data in they can use it. Â Easily, without a struggle.</p>

    <link href="http://maploser.com/blog/2012/03/04/odbl-what-the-heck-can-you-do-with-it/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-04T04:01:30+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://maploser.com/blog/2012/03/04/odbl-what-the-heck-can-you-do-with-it</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, I've never pretended to be a lawyer and I'm not qualified to give legal advice. This is myÂ interpretationÂ of what the ODbL license means for usage in OpenStreetMap and what I am going to follow unless someone tells me otherwise.</em></p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Though my work at the <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a>Â I am often asked questions about the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> license, which is in process to switch from <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC-BY-SA 2.0</a> to <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/">ODbL 1.0</a>. The <a href="http://www.osmfoundation.org/wiki/License/Why_CC_BY-SA_is_Unsuitable">OpenStreetMap Foundation</a> has written much about the reason for the switch, so I'm not going to go deeply into that other than CC-BY-SA does not work for data globally. The reason for this blog post though is when I haven't been deep in licensing for a while I tend to forget details, perhaps you have the same issue. Â This is for both of us to have a summary. The information below is specifically related to the OpenStreetMap project, there has been much community discussion and guidelines produced leading up to the license change. The usefulness of this information for other projects may vary.</p>

<p><em>note: OpenStreetMap is switching fully to ODbL on April 1st, so these guidelines will best apply after that date. Â They are however useful for planning now.</em></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The basic premise of ODbL is that the license provides that anyone can use the released data for commercial or non-commercial use. This is providing that you give attribution and if you improve the database you release the resulting database under ODbL or a similarÂ compatibleÂ license.</p>

<p>Part of ODbL is also the licensing of the data in the database, which requires the D<a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/dbcl/">atabase Contents License</a>Â or DbCL. I'm not going into this in this post other than to state it is the licensing of the content in the database. Additionally OpenStreetMap is adding contributor terms with the license change, this isÂ separateÂ from the license though will make it easier in the future to change or upgrade the license as needed.</p>

<h2>Important Terms</h2>

<p>There are a series of terms that by understanding make the reading of the license much easier. They are defined in the database under "1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words." There are a few that I think are most important in understanding of the license.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Database</p></li>
<li><p>Derivative Database</p></li>
<li><p>Produced Work</p></li>
<li><p>Extraction</p></li>
<li><p>Substantial: Refers to the data and the amount/quality of the data. In the OpenStreetMap wiki there are guidelines as to what is <em>Insubstantial</em>Â in reference to the OpenStreetMap project.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2><strong>Community Guidelines</strong></h2>

<p>Items that are not included in the important terms above, but are important for usage of OpenStreetMap specific data.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Insubstantial: Less than 100 Features. More than 100 Features if the extraction is non-systematic and clearly based on your own qualitative criteria. The features relate to an area of up to 1,000 inhabitants. (7)</p></li>
<li><p>Trivial Transformations: Situations where a derived database is created but releasing it doesn't really add value and the size of the database could possibly make it difficult to release. Â Examples are rendering databases, routing databases and geocoding databases.</p></li>
<li><p>Metadata Layers: Situations where other data is linked to OpenStreetMap data. For example a case where data e.g.Â restaurantÂ reviews is linked to the OpenStreetMap data by IDs.</p></li>
<li><p>Indexing: A situation where the data is indexed for example by a search engine.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Practical</h2>

<p>Both CC-BY-SA(<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">1</a>) and ODbL(<a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/">3</a>) have a human-readable summary of the license as well as the full-license. Both explain at a high-level what you can do, but I think the issue with ODbL versus CC-BY-SA is people are more familiar with CC-BY-SA, meaning there are more examples of how to use it and what it means. The examples below are meant to clarify that.</p>

<p><em>note: I have borrowed heavily from the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Open_Data_License/Use_Cases">community guidelines for these examples</a> for the full set please look at them on the OpenStreetMap wiki</em></p>

<h3>Use of OpenStreetMap Data By Itself</h3>

<p>There are many cases where the use of the OpenStreetMap data by itself is all that is needed. Examples include creating a map for a website, indexing the data for use in a routing engine and creating a geocoding database.</p>

<h4>Creating a Map Image</h4>

<p>If you create a map rendering (image) from the OpenStreetMap data you are free to distribute this <em>produced work </em>as you see fit. Â The only requirements are you must attribute OpenStreetMap. The license on the <em>produced work </em>can be anything you want<em>. Â </em>So if I wanted to create a map for my newsletter showing a park that was well mapped in OpenStreetMap I'm allowed to do that. I can license the picture with whatever license I want.</p>

<p>Often cartographers take a rendered image and then manually make improvements to it. Â Usually this includes things like fixing label positioning, but may also include fixing errors. The resulting work of the artist can be released under any license they want as with the automated rendering, but the improvements for example the fixing errors must be released. It is suggested that the easiest way to do this maybe to <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Open_Data_License/Use_Cases#Using_OSM_data_for_the_production_of_a_hand-made_map">simply add the fixes back into OpenStreetMap</a>.</p>

<h4>Using the OpenStreetMap Data for Geocoding</h4>

<p>You have created a geocoder that using OpenStreetMap data by itself. Part of the process of geocoding is first indexing the data. There is a resultingÂ <em>derivedÂ work </em>in this case which is the geocoding database. Â According to the ODbL license <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Open_Data_License/Trivial_Transformations_-_Guideline">either the resulting database, the modifications or the algorithm should be provided</a>.</p>

<p><em>note: there is some disagreement about if these is how far OpenStreetMap would want to take this idea, but currently the interpretation of the license.</em></p>

<h4>Search Engine Indexes OpenStreetMap Data</h4>

<p>You have a search engine which crawls all the OpenStreetMap data. When a user searches for a specificÂ restaurantÂ on your search engine it provides a link to that restaurant on the OpenStreetMap website. This is considered <em><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Open_Data_License/Indexing_-_Guideline">fair use</a></em>Â in the OpenStreetMap community guidelines, this is because it indexing the OpenStreetMap webpages and these are <em>produced works</em>.</p>

<h3>Use of OpenStreetMap Data with Other Data</h3>

<h4>Geocoding Using OpenStreetMap</h4>

<p>AnÂ organizationÂ has a list of members and wants to geocode that list to create a map. The resulting geocoded address is a <em>derived database</em>, but at what point do they need to release under a compatible license? In this situation the guideline of what isÂ <em>substantial</em>(<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Open_Data_License/Substantial_-_Guideline">7</a>)Â comes into effect. According to the community guidelines if more than 100 records were in the database it would need to be released under ODbL.</p>

<h4>Improving Another Dataset</h4>

<p>Let's say you took the extract OpenStreetMap database and extracted all theÂ restaurants. Â You then manually went through all theÂ restaurantÂ to verify their locations and corrected those that were incorrect. Â You then used thisÂ <em>derivedÂ database </em>to make an internal presentation to your marketing department. In this case you did make aÂ <em>derivedÂ database</em>, but neither distributed the database or the produced work. Â It is unnecessary to then release the data under ODbL.</p>

<p>After your presentation your boss came to you and said they wanted to use the information from your presentation in a product helping other marketers analyzeÂ restaurantÂ locations. This would be distributed to all of your customers. Â In this case your <em>produced work </em>or perhaps yourÂ <em>derivedÂ database </em>depending on the type of product are being distributed so you would need to release the information ODbL.</p>

<h4>You reference IDs to the database from another database</h4>

<p>The example from the OpenStreetMap wiki is you have a site that collects restaurant reviews and you link those toÂ restaurantsÂ mapped in OpenStreetMap by the ID(<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Open_Data_License/Metadata_Layers_-_Guideline">10</a>). It is stated "The "Fairhurst Doctrine" (previously discussed on theÂ <a href="http://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/legal-talk/2009-October/002881.html">mailing list</a>) solves this by saying that any mapping of machine-produced primary keys (e.g: OSM node IDs to review IDs), as it doesn't "represent ... significant investment", doesn't meet the definition of "Substantial", therefore is not a Derivative Database."</p>

<p>My personal example of this is through some work that the <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a> has done in Indonesia. We've been working with community facilitators to help them map poverty. Â Building information goes directly into OpenStreetMap and the poverty information goes into aÂ separateÂ database linked by the OpenStreetMap ID. Originally this was done by typing the OSM ID directly into Excel, now there is an application that links the two. Â When someone wants to make a poverty map they download the OpenStreetMap data as a Shapefile and link it to their spreadsheet. When we built this system my understanding was that there was not issue because the data was not going to be distributed. Â The issue being that poverty data is private information and it isn't fair to expect people to make it public. Â According to the "Fairhurst Doctrine" it appears that we would be okay to distribute it to other groups without having to release it ODbL.</p>

    <link href="http://maploser.com/blog/2011/10/23/book-sprints-for-humanitarian-response/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-23T02:52:56+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://maploser.com/blog/2011/10/23/book-sprints-for-humanitarian-response</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past week I've been at Google in Mountain View working on a book sprint for OpenStreetMap.  I had no idea when the week started that we were going to write a book in a week, nor that it was possible to do that.  I also wasn't familiar with <a href="http://flossmanuals.net/">FLOSS Manuals</a> which operates under the premise that not only should software be open and free but the documentation should be as well.</p>

<p>The premise of the week was to bring individuals from open-source projects together as well as others specializing in documentation in as well to help.  A combination of an unconference and then intensive documentation writing ensued.  The OpenStreetMap group included Ian Dees, Shaun McDonald and myself from the project.  We additionally had Anne Goldenberg, Anne Gentle, Tomi Toivio and NÃ³irÃ­n Plunkett.  Having so many people from outside OpenStreetMap was extremely valuable.  They were able to help us be far more clear about the materials and see past assumptions we may have made about topics.  At the end we had a published book, which <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/openstreetmap/18173430">can be purchased from Lulu.com</a>. Having a completed work at the end of the sprint was a great feeling.  Often after hackathons that is missing for me and it ends up feeling like we just flogged ourselves with some code for a set period of time.</p>

<p>In going through this process I started to think about other topics that could benefit from this type of approach.  I started thinking about the topics that we go over repeatedly within the Humanitarian Open-Source, CrisisMappers and Volunteer Technology Communities (for lack of a better name).  I really think the community could benefit from a generic guide to issues within the humanitarian technology realm.  Topics such as standards, licensing and workflows could be documented.  It is impossible to say what exactly the book would cover, because that is determined as part of the book sprint process.  What I am proposing though is that it would be greatly beneficial to gather for this process.</p>

<p>Typically a book sprint would happen over roughly a week time with five to ten individuals with different experience on the topic.  I'm proposing the same thing. Let's plan a book sprint and figure out how to make it happen.  The idea would be to gather about ten people with different experience, everything from technologists to humanitarian responders to specialists in documentation.  This group would get together for an intensive week long book sprint, the goal being to create a manual of the basics of humanitarian technology.  Topics that come to mind for me are data licensing, standards, security, privacy and workflows.  I'm only one individual and I'm sure topics would change and mold to the importance decided on by the group.  The point though would be to create a resource useful within our community.</p>

<p>Does this sound interesting to you?  Contact me in the comments or by email and let's make it happen!</p>

    <updated>2011-06-27T13:09:58+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://maploser.com/blog/2011/06/27/off-to-join-the-circus</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well not really off to join the circus, most of you probably already know about my employment change. I'm now working for the <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a>.  I always referred to working on OpenStreetMap projects full-time as "running off to join the OpenStreetMap."   That isn't to say people haven't done it previous, I think it is just is something many would love to do and few have figured out how to.  Much like joining the circus, though you trade in your clown nose for a GPS.  Or at least it can take a bit of a leap of faith in someways.</p>

<p>Anyway I ended my full-time employment at GeoIQ on May 16th and began transitioning over to working for HOT.   I loved working for GeoIQ, my coworkers were wonderful and I really believe in the technology that was being built.  However last year after going to Haiti and working remotely on other projects HOT was helping on, I really found a calling.  Working on things for HOT is yet to have felt like work and I hope it never does.  After the transitioning my real first day of only working for HOT was about June 15th.  That day I attended a meeting in New York City with other members from the Volunteer Technical Communities and the United Nations (OCHA to be specific).  I thought this was a good kick-off to my new position, because it is one of my goals for myself.  To be able to help coordinate with large organizations and other tech response groups so we can all be more effective.   I also hope to do some fundraising for HOT so we can coordinate better when disasters do happen.  There is a need to have infrastructure, software to better assist with mapping as well as individuals to help coordinate.  This items don't always translate into the need for funding, but I think there are going to be situations where it will.</p>

<p>A couple days later that week I switched to the other role I want to play as well.  Coordinate projects and doing field work when possible.  On June 17th I left the United States to return to Indonesia.  Here I'm working on a pilot project to use OpenStreetMap to help collect information to be fed into risk models.  Myself and Jeff Haack are here and mainly focused on giving workshops on using OpenStreetMap, setting up simple tools to allow people to use the data and coordinate between the interested organizations.  At the end of the three months we'll look at how things went and determine with our partners if the pilot can turn into a project for all of Indonesia.  Saying all of Indonesia sounds scary, since it is 17,000 islands and many diverse people.  Though so far everyone we've worked with has been enthusiastic and quick to pick-up the tools as well, so I'm excited to see if it can work.  I think if things keep going the way they have so far it will.</p>

<p>So I will be in Indonesia until mid-August, but after that I'll be a bit all over the place.  If I happen to coincide with where you are maybe we can meet-up.  As always the best way to keep up with me is on <a href="http://twitter.com/wonderchook">Twitter</a> and hopefully I'll keep up the <a href="http://twitter.com/hotosm">HOT Twitter Account</a> better as well.</p>
