    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today the United Nations released their report "Disaster Relief 2.0: The Future of Information Sharing in Humanitarian Emergencies." Â Two members of the <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a> were interviewed for this report, myself and Nicolas Chavent. Â  Also of course many other from friend and partner organizations were interviewed as well.</p>

<p>For anyone interested in open data or new methods of crisis response I recommend you read the <a href="http://issuu.com/unfoundation/docs/disaster_relief20_report">whole report</a>. Â For others, well a seventy-two page report might seem like a bit much so what might be key is the <a href="http://www.unfoundation.org/assets/pdf/disaster-relief-2-findings-1.pdf">recommendations</a>. Â Key is the idea that information communities (called V&amp;TC in the report) came together after the earthquake in Haiti to help. Â Much of this revolved around the sharing and collection of data. Â The value of this type of activity to make a difference was clearly shown. Â The real question though is how do you make this happen again? Â And how can this fit into a framework that makes sense from the perspective of the large organizations as well as the informal communities.</p>

<p>The recommendations suggest a method so that the V&amp;TCs and the traditional humanitarian system can work together.  This includes 5 parts:</p>

<p>"1. A neutral forum to surface areas of agreement and conflict between international humanitarian system and the V&amp;TCs.
2. An innovation space where new tools and practices can be explored as experiments, allowing for the failures that are a necessary component of learning new ways of working.
3. A deployable field team with a mandate to deploy the best available tools and practices from the V&amp;TCs to the field.
4. A research and training consortium to evaluate the work in the field and to train humanitarians and V&amp;TCs alike in the best practices for information management in a humanitarian context.
5. A clear operational interface that outlines ways of collaborating before and during emergencies, with agreed procedures for communication, shared standards for data exchange and an understanding of roles, priorities and capabilities"</p>

<p>One of the key differences between technologists experimenting within the humanitarian response space versus a traditional technology start-up is the cost of failure. Â Remember in the early days of Â Twitter when things went down all the time? Â Or other technologies that didn't work quite right? Â Well, usually the risk is to shareholders, in crisis response this failure can translate to lives. Â  Â Hence the recommendation of a neutral space, an experimental zone, a deployment team and a way to communicate successes and failures back. Â In some ways this is taking what people were already doing in informal ways and giving it formal pathways.</p>

<p>I think much as new technologies replace old in the start-up space there will still be innovation from outside within the crisis response space. Â If the innovation space is working in anÂ optimumÂ setting it will be able to operationalize these techniques coming up outside the formal structures. Â Though I suspect some will still slip through, since when there is an emergency people will use what is simple, they know and what works. Â No matter what I think if these recommendations are adopted it will be a step forward in bringing the formal and informal groups together.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in the beginning of October I attended the <a href="http://www.crisismappers.net/page/iccm-2010-haiti-and-beyond">International Conference on Crisis Mapping</a>.  The first day of the event was open to the public and included many ignite talks on a variety of topics related to crisis response.  I gave a talk titled "Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team in Haiti: from Crisis to Capacity Building."  I highlighted how HOT has been working to transfer the maintenance of the Haiti portion of the map to Haiti as well as some ways the data is currently being used.</p>
