    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in October I spoke at <a href="http://www.ignite-dc.com">Ignite DC #2</a> about <a href="http://mappingdc.org">MappingDC</a> and <a href="http://www.osm.org">OpenStreetMap</a>. Â An Ignite event structure is 16 speakers who each speak for 5 minutes with auto-rotating slides.  This was my first time participating in Ignite as a speaker and it was great to talk about mapping.  Since my talk MappingDC has continued to have mapping parties and work on importing <a href="http://dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/site/default.asp">DC GIS</a> data.</p>

<p>The next <a href="http://ignitedc3.eventbrite.com/">Ignite DC is on February 18th</a>, there are only sponsorship tickets left. If you are lucky enough to already have a ticket I'll see you there.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday this week we are having the first edition of "OSM Editing Tips and Tricks" for <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mappingdc">MappingDC</a>.  Every time I get together with other <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.com">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors I learn something that makes it easier to edit/add data to OSM. Â The last time I edited together in a room with others was at <a href="http://www.wherecamp5280.org/">WhereCamp5280</a>. Â Mostly then I learned short-cut keys for Potlatch and I had for some reason missed how to add tags that were not in the short-cuts such as "building=yes" from Potlatch. Â Up until that point I had been digitizing off the Yahoo Imagery and then going into JOSM to clean things up. Â This method sounds totally inefficient now.</p>

<p>We are meeting at <a href="http://www.hacdc.org">HacDC</a> which is at <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=38.933486&amp;lon=-77.035943&amp;zoom=18&amp;layers=B000FTF">1525 Newton St NW, Washington DC 20010</a> at 7pm. Â Hope to see you there.</p>
