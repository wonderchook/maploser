<div class="entry-content"><p>There is no question the collaboration of the OpenStreetMap community in the month following the earthquake in Haiti was amazing.  People from all over the world traced satellite imagery and imported data to create comprehensive street data for Port-au-Prince and the rest of the earthquake affected parts of the country.  After reading <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2010/09/02/crisis-commons-and-the-challenges-of-distributed-disaster-response/">this Ethan Zuckerman blog post</a>, I wanted to do some analysis of who exactly made the map. Was it primarily the already existing <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> community?  Or was it those who didn&#8217;t want to just text message their ten dollars and actually wanted to do something to help and OpenStreetMap became a venue for that?  This new group would mostly individuals coming from <a href="http://crisiscommons.org/">CrisisCommons</a> during the many CrisisCamps that occurred during this time.  I&#8217;ve always stated that it was the already existing OpenStreetMap community that did the majority of the map, but I was going on gut instinct, not actual statistics and facts.</p>

<p>What was lacking to provide facts and statistics was an analysis of the edits that occurred in the first month in Haiti.  Ian Dees was nice enough to download the daily edits from January 12th through Feburary 11th for me and put them in a SQLite database.  If you wish to do your own analysis that database is available <a href="http://www.maploser.com/edits.sqlite">here</a>.  I did all of my analysis in SQLite with queries, except for the graphs you see, which were created in OpenOffice.  It should also be noted that editing a node within the context of my analysis means either creating, deleting or changing a node.  A node for those not fluent in OSM terminology is essentially a point.  Multiple nodes strung together create lines and a series of nodes that connect back to each other create polygons.  So here is a somewhat belated but I believe necessary analysis.</p>

<p>The first OSM users to edit in Haiti after the earthquake were <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/ikiya">ikiya</a> and <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/lyx">lyx</a>.  What I thought was striking is that they live on opposite sides of the world, one in Japan and the other in Germany.  They began editing at 9:00 GMT January 13th, 12 hours after the earthquake occurred.  Other than the first editors I also looked at information on the most edits from various perspectives.</p>

<p>The most total editors in an hour was 41 which occurred on January 24th at 16:00 GMT,  8,531 nodes were edited that hour.  The most nodes ever edited in a single hour during this time was 39,523 by 28 people on Saturday, January 16th at 17:02:10 GMT.  Though it should be noted 33,000 of those nodes were the import of Haiti boundaries.  The next highest amount of node edits was at Wed, February 10th 2010 21:02:09 GMT with only 5 people editing a total of 25,098 nodes.  The individual who had the most edits who wasnâ€™t the Haiti_boundaries_import user was <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/rab">rab</a>.  Though these various leader boards of edits are interesting they do not answer my initial question.  Who made the majority of the contribution to the map?  Those who were already existing OpenStreetMap contributors or those that began editing OpenStreetMap specifically after the earthquake in Haiti.</p>

<p>Of the top 40 editors in terms of number of nodes edited during the first month only 1 signed up after the earthquake, everyone else was already an OSM user before.  Total editors during this time period was 605, though it should be noted a handful were bots and imports.  The total editors who signed up after the quake was 230 and they edited 206,682 nodes for an average of 244 nodes edited per user.  Of those 65,390 were by the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Haiti_boundaries_import">Haiti_boundaries_import</a> user.  The contributors who signed up before the earthquake contributed edits to 1,215,510 nodes for an average of 267 nodes edited each.  The total number of nodes edited during this first month as 1,422,205.  The top 10 contributors edited 471,520 of these nodes.  On the other end of the spectrum were those that edited a single node, 183 accounts total.  Of those 183 there were 52 that signed up after the earthquake and 130 before.</p>

<p>To better display the various breakdowns of edits by day I created a series of line graphs.  Each graph contains values by all editors, editors who signed up before the earthquake and editors who signed up after the earthquake.  The line labeled &#8220;Column B&#8221; is always all editors, &#8220;Column C&#8221; those that signed up afterward the earthquake and &#8220;Column D&#8221; those that signed up before the earthquake.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;597&#8221; caption=&#8221;Total Nodes Edited per Day&#8221;]<img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4130/4962791275_dab2906600_o.png" alt="Total Nodes Edited per Day" />[/caption]</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;623&#8221; caption=&#8221;Average Nodes Edited per User By Day&#8221;]<img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4133/4962784755_a61a964928_o.png" alt="Average Nodes Edited per User By Day" />[/caption]</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;601&#8221; caption=&#8221;Total Users Editing per Day&#8221;]<img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4087/4963374550_e7562f8d95_o.png" alt="Total Users Editing per Day" />[/caption]</p>

<p>From looking at different breakdowns of the edits that occurred in the month after the earthquake in Haiti one can see that the majority of the data edited came from the already existing OpenStreetMap Community.  85% of nodes edited in Haiti during this month were by those with already existing OpenStreetMap accounts.  Not only were the majority of the nodes, but also the majority of editors, a total of 375.  The new contributors did make a contribution to OpenStreetMap during this time, but the vast majority of edits were by those already using OSM.</p>
