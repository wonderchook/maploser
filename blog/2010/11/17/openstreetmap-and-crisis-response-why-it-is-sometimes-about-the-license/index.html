<div class="entry-content"><p>I had the privilege of being on a panel at Civil Society 2.0 organized by the State Department a couple weeks ago.  The event got me thinking further about the relationship between OpenStreetMap and crisis response, I didn&#8217;t manage to organize my thoughts into a blog post until now though.</p>

<p>OpenStreetMap and other crowdsourcing groups such as <a href="http://ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a> and <a href="http://crisiscommons.org/">CrisisCommons</a> got a lot of attention this year after the earthquake in Haiti.  OpenStreetMap has a different goal than these other groups, the goal can be summed as &#8220;create a free map of the entire world&#8221;.  That aim though is key, it isn&#8217;t &#8220;to create a free map for crisis response&#8221; or to &#8220;support humanitarian work with a free map.&#8221;  This difference in ambition can sometimes cause confusion between those joining the OSM community because they want to help with crisis response.</p>

<p>Haiti was different from other disasters, both because of the scale and how the disaster happened in an instant.  It was different then other events this year as far as OpenStreetMap is concerned as well.  The initial major difference was the availability of free imagery that could be used to trace information.  A second factor was information being reported from the ground from people actually using the map.  Imagery available for the floods in Pakistan as well as the tropical storm in the Philippines was not as detailed or prolific.  There has been frustration from some people that the response when asking OpenStreetMap for help in these situations is &#8220;what is the license on the data and imagery you already have?&#8221;  I can understand how this question is sometimes met with shock, people are displaced, injured and dying, all you can ask about is data licenses?</p>

<p>The OpenStreetMap community really rallied around helping Haiti.  People edited data, others created map products and even others processed imagery to be used by all.  I reviewed the statistics on what types of contributors performed the editing in a <a href="http://www.maploser.com/?p=279">previous blog post</a> and came to the conclusion is was mostly already contributing members.  Those contributors are the same people who work on other projects within the community and after the initial need for creation of the map of Haiti they went back to the projects they previous worked on.  It is the returning to their previous projects which I think becomes key in the &#8220;why can&#8217;t you just break the license?&#8221; question.  Once the OpenStreetMap data has broken licenses and the &#8220;freeness&#8221; of the data comes into question that great community around it starts to break down.  If you can&#8217;t use the data for whatever purpose you desire then there is not much incentive to contribute data.  If OpenStreetMap loses that community that was able to switch from their routine projects to help in Haiti then it ceases to be useful for crisis response.  If it loses its thousands of contributors that have created maps of areas were they aren&#8217;t others then it also ceases to be useful for crisis response.  It would be difficult to have a organization that only wanted to create map data for crisis response, you would likely have spotty coverage only where disasters had previously occurred or in extremely high risk areas.</p>

<p>My response when asked why OpenStreetMap can&#8217;t make an exception to its license for crisis response from now on is going to be &#8220;Why can&#8217;t others make exceptions to their license for crisis response?&#8221;  The key sticking point between many data and satellite providers and OpenStreetMap is that OSM allows the data to be used commercially.  This commercial use is what allows companies such as <a href="http://fortiusone.com">FortiusOne</a>, <a href="http://mapquest.com">Mapquest</a>, <a href="http://www.geofabrik.de/">GeoFabrik</a>, <a href="http://www.geofabrik.de/">Cloudmade</a> and many others to build services and tools utilizing the data.  Those tools built before a disaster for commercial use, then become very useful when needed by the response community.  Examples include my employer FortiusOne making maps and data available on <a href="http://geocommons.com">GeoCommons</a> and GeoFabrik creating different types of <a href="http://labs.geofabrik.de/haiti/">data downloads for Haiti</a> which are still in use on the ground there today.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/weblog/">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a> with organizations to have imagery and other data be available for crisis response.  These are usually large organizations who haven&#8217;t dealt with a community such as OpenStreetMap before though, so this will take some time.</p>
