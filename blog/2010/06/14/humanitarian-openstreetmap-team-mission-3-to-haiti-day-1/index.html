<div class="entry-content"><p>Today I&#8217;m off on a 2 and a half week trip with the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Humanitarian_OSM_Team">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a> in Haiti. After the earthquake in January OpenStreetMap proved to be an invaluable basemap of Haiti.  Initially all of the edits were occurring remotely from all over the world.  The community within OSM created various extracts of the data used by GIS Analysts, USARS teams and many others working on the ground and from afar.  The amazing collaboration during that time has been captured in various blog posts and<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJvR84UX5RI"> conference talks.
</a>
Now that actions have switched from immediate emergency to rebuilding and cleanup the goals of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team have changed some as well.  Our focus is on capacity building and training those working on the ground.  Through intensive all day training sessions we lead groups from data collection with GPS and Walking Papers to editing within JOSM (Java OpenStreetMap Editor).  Following up on two previous missions that included mapping within Port-au-Prince and Jacmel our intent is to continue moving outward into other cities within Haiti.  Now that hurricane season is upon us building this mapping capacity is more important than ever.</p>

<p>Preparation for our trip proved intensive.  There were vaccines to obtain, equipment to procure and training materials to create and review.  I was primarily responsible for creating more H.O.T. Kits as we call them.  A H.O.T. Kit is a pelican case containing a printer/scanner, a laptop, GPS units, batteries and an external hard drive for data.  Currently there are already two such kits in Haiti left behind from previous missions, but as we expand into other areas the need for more kits was clear.  The kits are left behind in country after the H.O.T. Team leaves to continued editing and collection of OpenStreetMap data can happen.  There was no additional budget for more kits for this mission. Fortunately the community once again proved amazing, I was able to raise <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/weblog/?page_id=13">$1000.00 for GPS units</a> and ESRI donated laptops.</p>

<p>The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team wouldn&#8217;t be anything without the people.  We are following up on the amazing groundwork laid by <a href="http://dbsgeo.com/">Dane Springmeyer</a>,<a href="http://developmentseed.org/team/robert-soden"> Robert Soden</a> and Nicolas Chavent on two previous missions.  This mission includes the amazing guidance of Nicolas Chavent bringing his invaluable experience from the previous two missions as well as three new actors including myself, <a href="http://toddhuffman.pbworks.com/">Todd Huffman</a> and <a href="http://ellermann.net/">Trevor Ellermann</a>.  Everyone brings their own unique experiences and skills to the team.  Nicolas and his key GIS and humanitarian experience, myself with my experience in mapping in a variety of field conditions with many types of data.  Todd&#8217;s creativity solving problems in unique ways in difficult environments and Trevor&#8217;s technical skills in system administration and programming.</p>

<p>Naturally the most compelling reason I felt to join this mission was to help.   Having the opportunity to assist in a more hands on way than I have previously is a privilege.  The secondary but more personally compelling reason I felt to go to Haiti is to see the land I&#8217;ve spent the past months intensively mapping, discussing and coordinating data around.  The only comparable effort I was involved in was during Katrina five years ago.  I didn&#8217;t actually visit New Orleans until a month ago, even five years later to experience the land I spent so much time looking at above was a learning experience.  You learn so much more about imagery interpretation and data analysis by actually being in the environment you are analyzing.  I hope that my trip will enable me to be even more effective in the future in other response efforts.</p>
