  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well not really off to join the circus, most of you probably already know about my employment change. I&#8217;m now working for the <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a>.  I always referred to working on OpenStreetMap projects full-time as &#8220;running off to join the OpenStreetMap.&#8221;   That isn&#8217;t to say people haven&#8217;t done it previous, I think it is just is something many would love to do and few have figured out how to.  Much like joining the circus, though you trade in your clown nose for a GPS.  Or at least it can take a bit of a leap of faith in someways.</p>

<p>Anyway I ended my full-time employment at GeoIQ on May 16th and began transitioning over to working for HOT.   I loved working for GeoIQ, my coworkers were wonderful and I really believe in the technology that was being built.  However last year after going to Haiti and working remotely on other projects HOT was helping on, I really found a calling.  Working on things for HOT is yet to have felt like work and I hope it never does.  After the transitioning my real first day of only working for HOT was about June 15th.  That day I attended a meeting in New York City with other members from the Volunteer Technical Communities and the United Nations (OCHA to be specific).  I thought this was a good kick-off to my new position, because it is one of my goals for myself.  To be able to help coordinate with large organizations and other tech response groups so we can all be more effective.   I also hope to do some fundraising for HOT so we can coordinate better when disasters do happen.  There is a need to have infrastructure, software to better assist with mapping as well as individuals to help coordinate.  This items don&#8217;t always translate into the need for funding, but I think there are going to be situations where it will.</p>

<p>A couple days later that week I switched to the other role I want to play as well.  Coordinate projects and doing field work when possible.  On June 17th I left the United States to return to Indonesia.  Here I&#8217;m working on a pilot project to use OpenStreetMap to help collect information to be fed into risk models.  Myself and Jeff Haack are here and mainly focused on giving workshops on using OpenStreetMap, setting up simple tools to allow people to use the data and coordinate between the interested organizations.  At the end of the three months we&#8217;ll look at how things went and determine with our partners if the pilot can turn into a project for all of Indonesia.  Saying all of Indonesia sounds scary, since it is 17,000 islands and many diverse people.  Though so far everyone we&#8217;ve worked with has been enthusiastic and quick to pick-up the tools as well, so I&#8217;m excited to see if it can work.  I think if things keep going the way they have so far it will.</p>

<p>So I will be in Indonesia until mid-August, but after that I&#8217;ll be a bit all over the place.  If I happen to coincide with where you are maybe we can meet-up.  As always the best way to keep up with me is on <a href="http://twitter.com/wonderchook">Twitter</a> and hopefully I&#8217;ll keep up the <a href="http://twitter.com/hotosm">HOT Twitter Account</a> better as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Though I was involved in the planning of <a href="http://www.wherecampdc.org/">WhereCampDC</a>, I missed the actual event for the most part. Â Instead I spent the week in Fiesole, Italy at the <a href="http://vespucci.org/">VespucciÂ Institute</a> (I&#8217;m sure all of you are now crying for me that missed WhereCampDC). Â At least there is <a href="http://www.wherecampdc.org/2011/04/friday-ignite-spatial/">video taken of the Ignite Spatial talks held at National Geographic</a>.</p>

<p>The combination of the strong geo community in DC plus a great crowd traveling in for the event made the talks really exceptional. Â I was really excited to see<a href="http://sproke.blogspot.com/"> Sophia Parafina&#8217;s</a> talk &#8220;WMS is Dead.&#8221; Just the title stirs up controversy among the geonerds, controversy is always a good aspect to an ignite talk.</p>

<p>No matter what realm of the geospatial world you come from I think there is something to be learned from her talk.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jatorre">Javier de la Torre</a> took a different approach to his talk and just showed a really great project. Â I&#8217;m always surprised when someone hasn&#8217;t heard of <a href="http://www.oldweather.org/">Old Weather</a>, it is my favorite crowd-sourcing project (well other than OpenStreetMap;)). Â The only good source of weather data from 100 years or more ago is ships&#8217; logs. Â Old Weather makes it fun to transcribe that information and yes you can become the captain of a ship!</p>

<p>All the talks are <a href="http://www.wherecampdc.org/2011/04/friday-ignite-spatial/">listed on the WhereCampDC website</a>, I suggest if you missed the event like I did you check them out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today the United Nations released their report &#8220;Disaster Relief 2.0: The Future of Information Sharing in Humanitarian Emergencies.&#8221; Â Two members of the <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a> were interviewed for this report, myself and Nicolas Chavent. Â  Also of course many other from friend and partner organizations were interviewed as well.</p>

<p>For anyone interested in open data or new methods of crisis response I recommend you read the <a href="http://issuu.com/unfoundation/docs/disaster_relief20_report">whole report</a>. Â For others, well a seventy-two page report might seem like a bit much so what might be key is the <a href="http://www.unfoundation.org/assets/pdf/disaster-relief-2-findings-1.pdf">recommendations</a>. Â Key is the idea that information communities (called V&amp;TC in the report) came together after the earthquake in Haiti to help. Â Much of this revolved around the sharing and collection of data. Â The value of this type of activity to make a difference was clearly shown. Â The real question though is how do you make this happen again? Â And how can this fit into a framework that makes sense from the perspective of the large organizations as well as the informal communities.</p>

<p>The recommendations suggest a method so that the V&amp;TCs and the traditional humanitarian system can work together.  This includes 5 parts:</p>

<p>&#8220;1. A neutral forum to surface areas of agreement and conflict between international humanitarian system and the V&amp;TCs.
2. An innovation space where new tools and practices can be explored as experiments, allowing for the failures that are a necessary component of learning new ways of working.
3. A deployable field team with a mandate to deploy the best available tools and practices from the V&amp;TCs to the field.
4. A research and training consortium to evaluate the work in the field and to train humanitarians and V&amp;TCs alike in the best practices for information management in a humanitarian context.
5. A clear operational interface that outlines ways of collaborating before and during emergencies, with agreed procedures for communication, shared standards for data exchange and an understanding of roles, priorities and capabilities&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the key differences between technologists experimenting within the humanitarian response space versus a traditional technology start-up is the cost of failure. Â Remember in the early days of Â Twitter when things went down all the time? Â Or other technologies that didn&#8217;t work quite right? Â Well, usually the risk is to shareholders, in crisis response this failure can translate to lives. Â  Â Hence the recommendation of a neutral space, an experimental zone, a deployment team and a way to communicate successes and failures back. Â In some ways this is taking what people were already doing in informal ways and giving it formal pathways.</p>

<p>I think much as new technologies replace old in the start-up space there will still be innovation from outside within the crisis response space. Â If the innovation space is working in anÂ optimumÂ setting it will be able to operationalize these techniques coming up outside the formal structures. Â Though I suspect some will still slip through, since when there is an emergency people will use what is simple, they know and what works. Â No matter what I think if these recommendations are adopted it will be a step forward in bringing the formal and informal groups together.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I <a href="http://blog.fortiusone.com/2011/02/14/our-trip-to-redlands-gis-week/">wrote about</a> in the <a href="http://fortiusone.com/">FortiusOne</a> blog, last week was <a href="http://redlandsgisweek.org/">Redlands GIS Week</a>. Â My post there concentrated more on the future of crowd-sourced geographic data in crisis response and ways to more quickly turn that data into information. Â That is something that I&#8217;ve spent quite of bit of time thinking about through my work on <a href="http://geocommons.com/">GeoCommon</a>s, as well as my work with the <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/weblog/">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a>. Â I spent so much time thinking about enabling crowd-sourcing of information and teaching people to edit in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> that something I&#8217;ve never thought much about is the stamping of data to make it authoritative. Â During a break-out group at GIS Week we were supposed to discuss &#8216;the Issues with VGI.&#8221; Â Nothing really new to me as far as issues came out of the discussion, one realization did occur was I have previously made data authoritative or authoritating it as I have started saying tongue in cheek.</p>

<p>I think part of the reason I&#8217;ve never really thought about this is that to me data is either authoritative or it is not, but that isn&#8217;t what determines how I use it. Â One of the previous jobs I had was doing data quality assurance, during that time I found many errors in that is considered authoritative data. Â Because of this previous job I have a lot of experience evaluating data. Â Everyone should do some evaluation of data before they use it, but it really depends on the type and the source how much they actually need to do. Â In thinking about this evaluation I began to think about the process of when we &#8220;qa&#8217;d&#8221; data before it was delivered to customers. Â Essentially that QA process was making dataÂ authoritative. Â What we were actually doing to create the data was not much different from the crowd-source efforts of many groups today though.</p>

<p>There was usually an expert in the field we were creating datasets for who would figure out what to be collected. Â The majority of the actual research though was done by interns or recent college grads. Â These people scoured the internet mostly, but wouldÂ occasionallyÂ call to confirm information. Â Once a new dataset was created or an old one updated it would go through a quality assurance process. Â Much of this was running automated tools to look for data that did not conform to what was expected. Â For example geocodes in the wrong state/zip, phone numbers of the wrong length and comparing the new data to old when possible. Â Then we would manually look for errors in the data. Â Once we decided information was &#8220;good enough&#8221; it would be pushed out to customers. Â This is the point where the data became &#8220;authoritative.&#8221; Â In the whole data creation process I estimate each dataset was touched between two and one hundred sets of hands. Â Two if the expert created the dataset by themselves and then one person tested it. Â One hundred if the dataset had been around through multiple updates that large groups of people worked on. Â If you compare this to the number of hands datasets from the CrisisMappers list, such as the recent mapping of polling stations in Sudan or the road data for OpenStreetMap the authoritativeÂ data hasn&#8217;t even been gone through as thoroughly as the non-authoritative data source. Â  Also if a mistake was found in the authoritative data source it would have to be updated and go through the whole quality assurance process again. Â What really is the difference between the two types of data in this case?</p>

<p>To me, really just that a company put their name on the authoritative data. Â I suppose if you are a buyer of the data you would have some recourse if there was a problem with the information. Â You could probably ask for all or some portion of your money back, if things went really wrong you could sue. Â Though in my examples I believe the crowd-sourced information had been more reviewed, so perhaps the chance of having issue with it is less. I realize this comparison does not work in the case of all datasets, though it is something to think about when discrediting crowd-sourced data. From where did your authoritative data come?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week, I&#8217;m visiting my GeoGlitterDomination partner <a href="http://twitter.com/theaclay">Thea Clay</a> in Texas. We&#8217;ve been doing a variety of Texas related things such as eating barbecue and touring the Alamo.  It goes without saying that we&#8217;ve also been mapping as we go.  One thing we did that was both Texas and geonerd, was we visited the <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/">University of Texas Map Room</a>.  In the basement of one of libraries there is a huge paper map collection.  Rows and rows of maps ranging from world maps to maps of individual cities.  Many of these maps have been scanned and made available online, but it was awesome to see the original paper maps.  There were old Russian maps of Afghanistan from the early 80s, world maps from all types of snapshots in time and a collection of rows and rows of USGS topomaps to highlight a couple favorites.</p>

<p>One of the things I made sure to look at was the maps of Haiti there.  We looked through the original paper copies of the old U.S. Defense Mapping Agency maps which were used to add the original road names to <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> immediately after the earthquake.  At the time we used the scanned maps which are still available <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/haiti.html">here</a>, but within all the rows of drawers in the map room were the originals.  Another map in the drawer I found to be interesting was a Texaco road map from the 1970s of Haiti which marked all the major roads as well as the Texaco stations there.  The library <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/faq.html#4.html">can&#8217;t scan copyrighted maps</a> which is why you don&#8217;t see this map online (I did snap a picture of it).</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;645&#8221; caption=&#8221;70s Map of Haiti from Texaco&#8221;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/35700286@N03/5307131898/sizes/o/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5084/5307131898_f43732c157_b_d.jpg" alt="70s Map of Haiti from Texaco" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Unfortunately the library was closing so we were a bit rushed (one of the reason I neglected to get a photo of the actual map room).  Though if you are a geonerd and find yourself in Austin this is a stop I highly recommend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This year I had the privilege of both attending my first <a href="http://stateofthemap.org/">State of the Map Conference</a> and hosting the first <a href="http://www.sotm.us/">State of the Map U.S. Conference</a>. For those unaware State of the Map is the annual meeting of the OpenStreetMap Community.  This year it took place in Girona, Spain over three days.  The first day is a business day and the second two are community days.  Big announcements this year on the business day included Mapquest stating they had a million dollar budget to increase mapping in the United States and Bing maps making OpenStreetMap tiles an option in their system.  What I was most excited about was the opportunity for HOT to meet together in person for the first time.  Who knows what excitement the following year will bring.</p>

<p>For this coming year I get the best of both worlds since the big State of the Map is taking place in Denver, Colorado.  We aren&#8217;t going to do a U.S. State of the Map since two conferences in one year seems like a bit much.  The event is September 9th-11th and it promises to be an awesome event.  It is abutting <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org/">FOSS4G</a> as well, which means there will be a full week of various types of geonerding.   This is a great opportunity for those who have participated in OpenStreetMap in North America.   The cost of traveling to Europe has been prohibitive for many in the past, so hopefully this will get more of us together as well as joining us more closely with the rest of the larger OpenStreetMap community.</p>

<p>One project the U.S. Chapter of OpenStreetMap has been talking about for the past couple months is the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/GeoBus">GeoBus</a> project.  The goal is to travel the U.S. by car/bus/truck or really any sort of vehicle we can get our hands on mapping the whole way.  Right now there has been an initial trip to North Carolina for mapping and one in Leigh High Valley in Pennsylvania.  We are hoping to do additional trips throughout the next year.  I think since State of the Map is in the United States the perfect way to get there is by driving.  My minimum plan is to take my own car and head out to Denver.  Though if there are others interested we can come up with another plan since it only comfortably seats two or three people.  I want to make sure to leave plenty of time was well so that we can map lots of interesting landmarks along the way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Monday night some of FortiusOne was having drinks with <a href="http://geothought.blogspot.com/">Peter Batty</a>, we were sad to be missing WhereCamp5280 this week though.  However in a last minute flash of geonerd brilliance <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/">Andrew Turner</a> booked himself and I last minute flights to Denver for <a href="http://www.wherecamp5280.org">WhereCamp5280</a>.  The second year of this unconference of all things location and geo I&#8217;m excited to see what sessions people propose this year.  Last year there were talks on everything from <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> by my now coworker <a href="http://twitter.com/cwhelm">Chris Helm</a> to <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> to traditional GIS.  This year there appears to be many more people coming from out of town so I expect even more excitement.  Supermayor coconspirators <a href="http://www.mweisman.com/">Michael Wiseman</a> and <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/">James Fee</a> as well as fellow <a href="https://twitter.com/timeline/search?q=geoglitterdomination">GeoGlitterDomination</a> expert <a href="http://twitter.com/theaclay">Thea Clay</a> are attending just to name a few.</p>

<p>Things kick off with a <a href="http://wc5280hack.pbworks.com/w/page/31710459/WhereCamp-5280-Unofficial-Programmers-meetup">hackday today</a>. I&#8217;m hoping to continue work on pushing more social media streams into GeoCommons for temporal analysis, though if previous events are any indication it is entirely possible someone will have a shiny other project I&#8217;ll get distracted by.  Tomorrow is the regular unconference which I expect a similar mix of academic geography, open source and traditional GIS, though perhaps with a bit more neogeography mixed in this year.  I won&#8217;t be attending the Saturday event but there is <a href="http://www.meetup.com/OSM-Colorado/calendar/14925674/">ski mapping party</a> as well.   Overall I&#8217;m excited for a fun couple of days of geohacking and discussion!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in the beginning of October I attended the <a href="http://www.crisismappers.net/page/iccm-2010-haiti-and-beyond">International Conference on Crisis Mapping</a>.  The first day of the event was open to the public and included many ignite talks on a variety of topics related to crisis response.  I gave a talk titled &#8220;Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team in Haiti: from Crisis to Capacity Building.&#8221;  I highlighted how HOT has been working to transfer the maintenance of the Haiti portion of the map to Haiti as well as some ways the data is currently being used.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had the privilege of being on a panel at Civil Society 2.0 organized by the State Department a couple weeks ago.  The event got me thinking further about the relationship between OpenStreetMap and crisis response, I didn&#8217;t manage to organize my thoughts into a blog post until now though.</p>

<p>OpenStreetMap and other crowdsourcing groups such as <a href="http://ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a> and <a href="http://crisiscommons.org/">CrisisCommons</a> got a lot of attention this year after the earthquake in Haiti.  OpenStreetMap has a different goal than these other groups, the goal can be summed as &#8220;create a free map of the entire world&#8221;.  That aim though is key, it isn&#8217;t &#8220;to create a free map for crisis response&#8221; or to &#8220;support humanitarian work with a free map.&#8221;  This difference in ambition can sometimes cause confusion between those joining the OSM community because they want to help with crisis response.</p>

<p>Haiti was different from other disasters, both because of the scale and how the disaster happened in an instant.  It was different then other events this year as far as OpenStreetMap is concerned as well.  The initial major difference was the availability of free imagery that could be used to trace information.  A second factor was information being reported from the ground from people actually using the map.  Imagery available for the floods in Pakistan as well as the tropical storm in the Philippines was not as detailed or prolific.  There has been frustration from some people that the response when asking OpenStreetMap for help in these situations is &#8220;what is the license on the data and imagery you already have?&#8221;  I can understand how this question is sometimes met with shock, people are displaced, injured and dying, all you can ask about is data licenses?</p>

<p>The OpenStreetMap community really rallied around helping Haiti.  People edited data, others created map products and even others processed imagery to be used by all.  I reviewed the statistics on what types of contributors performed the editing in a <a href="http://www.maploser.com/?p=279">previous blog post</a> and came to the conclusion is was mostly already contributing members.  Those contributors are the same people who work on other projects within the community and after the initial need for creation of the map of Haiti they went back to the projects they previous worked on.  It is the returning to their previous projects which I think becomes key in the &#8220;why can&#8217;t you just break the license?&#8221; question.  Once the OpenStreetMap data has broken licenses and the &#8220;freeness&#8221; of the data comes into question that great community around it starts to break down.  If you can&#8217;t use the data for whatever purpose you desire then there is not much incentive to contribute data.  If OpenStreetMap loses that community that was able to switch from their routine projects to help in Haiti then it ceases to be useful for crisis response.  If it loses its thousands of contributors that have created maps of areas were they aren&#8217;t others then it also ceases to be useful for crisis response.  It would be difficult to have a organization that only wanted to create map data for crisis response, you would likely have spotty coverage only where disasters had previously occurred or in extremely high risk areas.</p>

<p>My response when asked why OpenStreetMap can&#8217;t make an exception to its license for crisis response from now on is going to be &#8220;Why can&#8217;t others make exceptions to their license for crisis response?&#8221;  The key sticking point between many data and satellite providers and OpenStreetMap is that OSM allows the data to be used commercially.  This commercial use is what allows companies such as <a href="http://fortiusone.com">FortiusOne</a>, <a href="http://mapquest.com">Mapquest</a>, <a href="http://www.geofabrik.de/">GeoFabrik</a>, <a href="http://www.geofabrik.de/">Cloudmade</a> and many others to build services and tools utilizing the data.  Those tools built before a disaster for commercial use, then become very useful when needed by the response community.  Examples include my employer FortiusOne making maps and data available on <a href="http://geocommons.com">GeoCommons</a> and GeoFabrik creating different types of <a href="http://labs.geofabrik.de/haiti/">data downloads for Haiti</a> which are still in use on the ground there today.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/weblog/">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a> with organizations to have imagery and other data be available for crisis response.  These are usually large organizations who haven&#8217;t dealt with a community such as OpenStreetMap before though, so this will take some time.</p>
