 <div class="entry-content"><p>Sunday at <a href="http://www.wherecamppdx.org/">WhereCampPDX</a> was Locative Games. I played <a href="http://pacmanhattan.com/">PacManhattan</a> and did some geocaching.  I had heard of PacManhattan before, but playing is believing.  Essentially it is PacMan, but played in the real world with real people as both PacMan and the ghosts.  All of the ghosts wore rain ponchos to look more ghostlike.  Below is me playing Clyde.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;614&#8221; caption=&#8221;Image Courtesy of Spinnerin&#8217;s Flickr Stream&#8221;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ame/3983241192/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2582/3983241192_46ff8e3005_b.jpg" alt="Kate wearing a poncho playing Cylde the Ghost" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Apparently last year the game was played by calling back to homebase to update your position.  This year there was an web application that updated everyone&#8217;s location utilizes the javascript geolocation API in the phone.  The game works the same as regular PacMan, but PacMan picks up virtual pellets which disappear from his screen as he passes them.  There were some technical glitches with the iPhone updating location, but it was still a lot of fun.</p>

<p>The best part of the game was when we were walking to the starting corral.  Everyone was wearing a poncho despite the perfect weather and staring down at their phone.  We walked by a guy who tried to put his amusement into words, but just burst out laughing.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we did some geocaching.  Apparently standard geocaching latitude and longitude format is Degrees:Decimal Minutes, the iPhone applications most of us had didn&#8217;t support that format.  The two methods people used to make use of the points were either convert the locations to Decimal Degrees or download free iPhone apps until they found one that supported the format.  My geocaching partner <a href="http://reidbeels.com/">Reid Beels</a> and I opted to download iPhone apps until we found one that would work.  We settled on MotionX GPS Lite, which had an odd mix of features for a free app, I can only imagine what extra features the paid version has.  The free version had multiple map views and even iPod controls within it.  The one feature that was limited was that you could only save 3 waypoints.  Once we resolved the location format issues we were on our way and managed to come in second place.  For our efforts we won a compass, some <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/track/travelbugs.aspx">travel bug</a>s and a geocaching patch.  A travel bug is something trackable that moved from cache to cache.</p>

<p>Location games were a great followup to the hacking and sessions of the day before.  WhereCampPDX was one of the best unconferences I&#8217;ve ever attended.  It was well organized without being too controlled with a great a mix of people. Thanks everyone who organized as well as attended, it was an enjoyable time.</p>

 <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday was the unconference session portion of <a href="http://www.wherecamppdx.org/">WhereCampPDX</a>.  Meaning that there were sessions.  I lead a discussion on <a href="http://www.osm.org">OpenStreetMap</a> in the United States.  It was the first time people have worded questions to me in the form of &#8220;What does the OpenStreetMap think about&#8230;.&#8221;  Getting across the free flowing community was somewhat difficult to explain for some reason, even with the Wikipedia parallel.  A lot of interesting ideas came out of the session though, such as new renders for people that live or spend a lot of time outside.  A potential rending of places with external outlets, water and places to sleep for example.  There was also some interest in getting a two way data flow between government and OSM.  In Washington D.C. we have been discussing how that model could potentially work and it appears that other governments might forward once there are some sample models out there.</p>

<p>In addition to leading a session I also attended an assortment of sessions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="Geomena.org">Geomena</a> which is an open-source/open-data base of Wifi locations.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilizing Locative Technologies to Survive the Zombie Apocalypse</p></li>
<li><p>Virtual Geocaching and Games</p></li>
<li><p>Strange Maps</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a> Hacking Discussion (planning to utilize the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/foursquare-api">Foursquare api</a> for evening hacking)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All of these sessions were really enjoyable.  Next week I think I&#8217;m going to give the &#8220;Utilizing Locative Technologies to Survive the Zombie Apocalypse&#8221; its own update, because I can&#8217;t fit all the zombie goodness in this update.  Geomena really got me thinking about small hardware to collect WiFi locations.  I could potentially just stick a laptop in my car, but I think it would be even better to have something I could carry while on foot.  Since the iPhone battery life is not that great and it can&#8217;t have background processes I don&#8217;t think it is the ideal tool.  I was thinking perhaps an Android phone without having cellular service.</p>

<p>The Virtual Geocaching and Games was a fun session.  As an <a href="http://xkcd.com">XKCD</a> fan and geonerd I was somewhat surprised I had never heard of <a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Main_Page">geohashing</a>.  Geohashing essentially calculates a random place for people to meet.  The official meetups are 4pm every Saturday at you whole number Latitude and Longitude with the random calculator determining the decimal.  Mine graticule would be 38,-77.  <a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Washington_%28West%29%2C_District_of_Columbia">Washington D.</a>C. seems somewhat quiet in the geohashing realm, but I&#8217;d like to try to do it one day.</p>

<p>The Strange Maps discussion was somewhat based on the <a href="http://strangemaps.wordpress.com/">Strange Maps Blog</a>.  I think sessions where people just mention things they&#8217;ve seen revolving around a specific topic are always fun.  I read Strange Maps but not every post and there were also some maps mentioned that were not in there.  It was the session that people didn&#8217;t want to end.</p>

<p>In addition to the sessions there was also a keynote and an unpanel.  James Fee gave the keynote and discussed &#8221;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/cageyjames/wherecamppdx-keynote">Data Interoperability in the GeoWeb</a>.&#8221;  He&#8217;s always a geocrowd-pleaser and it was a good talk.  What I took away from it was easy to access data for the Cybernun and Spatialite for the professionals.  The unpanel was something I haven&#8217;t experienced before, just a general discussion with a panel regarding various topics in geo.  There were representatives from GIS, art, government and neocartography to stereotype a few.  I took a short <a href="http://qik.com/video/3089412">Qik Video of the Unpanel</a>, which is a good glimpse of what it was about.</p>

<p>Today there are locative games which I&#8217;m excited about, being a new realm for me to play in the style of meet somewhere and play a locative game.</p>

 <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I went to &#8221;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/rubyhacknight/calendar/11340056/">Hack Day &#8216;Effective Testing for Rails Projects&#8217;</a>&#8221; at <a href="http://www.viget.com/">Viget Labs</a> in Falls Church.  After Ruby DCamp I decided I was severely lacking in testing skills as a developer and I&#8217;m trying to do something to remedy that.  With the promise of &#8220;building a simple Rails application and a pair-programming environment&#8221; as well as &#8220;demonstrating effective testing techniques&#8221; I was sold.</p>

<p>I come from a Quality Assurance background so I am used to testing software as it is written.  Just in the past week have I felt like I am beginning to grasp testing software while it is written.  The live coding at Hack Day helped further that.   The example application we used was &#8221;<a href="http://github.com/mig/outtolunch">Out To Lunch</a>,&#8221; which is a simple app that utilizes the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation">Yelp API</a> to search for locations to eat and then will tell you where to eat lunch each day.</p>

<p>The session was lead by <a href="http://www.viget.com/about/team/preagan">Patrick Reagan</a> and <a href="http://www.viget.com/about/team/mswasey">Matt Swasey</a>, who did &#8220;Ping Pong Pairing&#8221; a type of paired programming I&#8217;d never seen before.  In ping pong pairing one developer writes a single test and then runs it and it fails.  Then the 2nd programmer writes code to make the test pass.  After that the first programmer writes another test and so on.  I&#8217;m a little bit competitive in nature and I think this would be a great way to pair.  Patrick and Matt each had their own keyboard and mouse and think that helps make the switching in this case go more smoothly.</p>

<p>We started with the Out to Lunch application from the beginning initially writing a test that asserted &#8220;should be able to accept a zip code&#8221; in the YelpSearcher class.  From there the code was written to accept the ZIP code and so on.  It was interesting to watch people work together and troubleshoot.  Since I&#8217;m fairly new to Ruby on Rails just watching people programming in it teaches me new techniques.  I also got some term definitions further straight in my head such as stub &#8220;a dummy object that will return whatever you want.&#8221;  I had never thought about when and where I should be using stubs in my testing before but now it really makes sense for unit tests, since you would want to break the code down to the simplest action possible.</p>

<p>I learned a ton in the three hour class and will be checking out <a href="http://www.meetup.com/rubyhacknight/">Ruby Hack Night</a> soon.</p>

 <div class="entry-content"><p>On Wednesday this week we are having the first edition of &#8220;OSM Editing Tips and Tricks&#8221; for <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mappingdc">MappingDC</a>. Every time I get together with other <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.com">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors I learn something that makes it easier to edit/add data to OSM.  The last time I edited together in a room with others was at <a href="http://www.wherecamp5280.org/">WhereCamp5280</a>.  Mostly then I learned short-cut keys for Potlatch and I had for some reason missed how to add tags that were not in the short-cuts such as &#8220;building=yes&#8221; from Potlatch.  Up until that point I had been digitizing off the Yahoo Imagery and then going into JOSM to clean things up.  This method sounds totally inefficient now.</p>

<p>We are meeting at <a href="http://www.hacdc.org">HacDC</a> which is at <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=38.933486&amp;lon=-77.035943&amp;zoom=18&amp;layers=B000FTF">1525 Newton St NW, Washington DC 20010</a> at 7pm.  Hope to see you there.</p>

 <div class="entry-content"><p>In the past I&#8217;ve had a history of only posting about the first day of a barcamp.  This is my attempt to buck that trend.</p>

<p>The second day of <a href="http://www.rubydcamp.org/">Ruby DCamp</a> was just as awesome as the first.  For visual proof of how great it was there is the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=rubydcamp">rubydcamp tag on flickr</a>. There is something special about making an unconference truly self sustained, it takes the &#8220;hallway conversation&#8221; to the next level and it becomes the &#8220;stabbing meat with sticks to feed 30 people conversation.&#8221;  That is what happens when you help make kabobs for lunch the second day.  I&#8217;m sure there were also great &#8220;drag the grill between the pavillion and the camp site conversations&#8221; and &#8220;carry enough firewood for the evening conversation.&#8221;  These aren&#8217;t normally geek conversation environments and I think it adds a great new dimension to the unconference.  Or in this case &#8220;Ruby Woodstock&#8221; as <a href="http://evan.tiggerpalace.com/">Evan Light</a> refered to it at some point.  I hope to see more barcamp&#8217;s follow this trend.  Thanks to Evan and everyone who made Ruby DCamp a great experience.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still digesting the technical knowledge I&#8217;ve learned, but I&#8217;ll share that at some point in my own geo-way here.</p>

 <div class="entry-content"><p>This is really a non-geo post, but I currently do a lot of geo-related programming in Ruby.</p>

<p><a href="http://rubydcamp.org/">Ruby DCamp</a> is the first unconference/barcamp I&#8217;ve attended where we actually camped. I&#8217;ve been to barcamps such as <a href="http://wherecamp.pbworks.com/">WhereCamp</a> that had a history of camping, but happened to be unable to the year I attended.  So far I think hosting the event in a part has been brilliant.  There has been wireless access, but since it is provided by peoples&#8217; broadband cards the request has been to be kind.</p>

<p>I think this has lead to people talking to each other even more than some other events I&#8217;ve attended.  As a relatively new rubyist I&#8217;ve learned a ton of techniques to try and tools to checkout.   One session was pair programming to practice writing tests. The application we started to write was <a href="http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans/blob/master/koans/GREED_RULES.txt">Greed</a>, a relatively simple dice game.  I think after going through that process I now could sit down with no code written and begin by writing tests instead of hacking some code out and then attempting to write tests in order to test it.  What was key for me was discussing things with someone and having them direct me in what tests we should write.</p>

<p>My favorite gem today was <a href="http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler">Jeweler</a>, when I&#8217;ve written gems up to this point I&#8217;ve created the gemspec and the file structure myself.  It never occurred to me to find a &#8220;rails like&#8221; tool to do that for me.   Jeweler even integrates instantly with <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a> and can set-up your repository for you.  We walked through the creation of a simple gem to learn the required commands.  It all starts with &#8220;jeweler your_gem_name&#8221; and then your gem structure is created and you just fill in the details.</p>

<p>One thought I had today was I would love to see a WhereCamp out in a park someday.  I know that in the past there has been camping on corporate headquarters, but there is something cool about the park vibe.  Today I could imagine people mapping the various park trails for OSM for example.  Someday I would like to have a WhereCamp in <a href="http://www.nps.gov/prwi/index.htm">Prince William Park</a>.  There is nothing wrong with <a href="http://www.nvrpa.org/parks/bullrun/index.php">Bull Run Park</a>, but Prince William has huge campgrounds with industrial kitchens and dining halls so it would allow for projectors and maybe ease in feeding a larger group.</p>

<p>So far this has been a great event and can&#8217;t wait to see what tomorrow brings.</p>

 <div class="entry-content"><p>On September 12th <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mappingdc">MappingDC</a> is going to join the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.com">OpenStreetMap</a> meme of mapping zoos in great detail.  A good example of this is the Dresden Zoo.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_145&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;368&#8221; caption=&#8221;OpenStreetMap contributors and Wikimedia Commons&#8221;]<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Dresden-Zoo-openstreetmap.png"><img src=" http://maploser.com/images/old-ml/2009/09/Dresden-Zoo-openstreetmap-1024x558.png" alt="OpenStreetMap contributors and Wikimedia Commons" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Other well mapped zoos I found were in <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Zoo_Hannover">Hannover</a>, <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Zoologischer_Garten_Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Zoo_Leipzig">Leipzig</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Zoo_Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>.</p>

<p>We plan to start by digitizing from the imagery available ahead of time and then utilizie GPS and <a href="http://www.walking-papers.org">Walking Papers</a> to then fill in gaps in the imagery and add detailed attributes.  The intent of the event is to teach people about the OpenStreetMap project as well as have fun micro-mapping.</p>

<p>Following our detailed data collection it appears we need to ensure the National Zoo has its own OpenStreetMap wiki page.  Some MappingDC members also would like to do a custom cartographic rendering, who knows if we are detailed enough maybe some zoo routing.  You never know when you might need the shortest route between the pandas and the lions.</p>

<p>If this sounds good to you join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mappingdc">MappingDC</a> Google group or contact me directly.  You don&#8217;t need a GPS or any prior knowledge we can help with that.</p>

<p>Updated: We are meeting at 10am at the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=38.92954&amp;lon=-77.05363&amp;zoom=17&amp;layers=B000FTF">Starbucks across from the Connecticut Ave Zoo Entrance</a>. (3000 Connecticut Ave NW Washington, DC 20008)</p>

 <div class="entry-content"><p>I attended a previous <a href="http://wherecamp.pbworks.com/WhereCamp2009">WhereCamp</a> this year in Palo Alto, that said I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect from WhereCamp5280. For those unfamiliar with <a href="http://www.barcamp.org/">BarCamps</a> they are unconferences which means the topics and schedule are determined by the participants the morning of the event. Also if the event is two days the schedule for the second day is not determined until the first day. Usually you kick off the day stating your name, your affilitation and three words/tags about yourself. I was somewhat concerned when multiple people said €œno tags.€ I think some of the problem was that many people had never been to this type of event before. The idea of the tags is to help everyone determine what everyone else is interested in and also to loosen everyone up a little. My tags where €œopen data, open source and OpenStreetMap.€ After this initial bump with the intros everything was very good from the individual conversations I had with people to the sessions and the very un-unconference plenary sessions.</p>

<p>The first two plenary sessions started things off with<a href="http://geothought.blogspot.com"> Peter Batty&#8217;s</a> talk on €œNeoGeoSchmeo.€ Essentially his thesis was that as neogeography has moved from simple Google Map mashups to advanced analytics and cartographic renderings there is no difference between old and new geo.</p>

<p>Peter&#8217;s talk was followed by James Fee&#8217;s talk about €œ<a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2009/08/14/wherecamp5280-presentation/">Problems in Data Sharing</a>.€ Which included a run down of government data portals that were difficult to use and returned questionable search results.</p>

<p>After these opening talks things moved into traditional barcamp style sessions. I attended a discussion on €œGeoGames€ with Andrei Taraschuk from <a href="http://www.umapper.com">Umapper</a>. Games he mentioned with a geo component, whether it be utilizing geodata or actually using the player&#8217;s location were The Last Guy, H.A.W.X., <a href="http://www.planetinaction.com/">PlanetInAction.com&#8217;s</a> GoogleEarth games and <a href="http://www.virtualpunk.com/">VirtualPunk</a>. VirtualPunk was one of the first times I had €œnon-iphone envy,€ it is a mobile java based game which looks pretty interesting. My interest in games is primarily that I love geo and I like to have fun, right now I play <a href="http://playfoursquare.com/">FourSquare</a> pretty regularly. I would like to see some way to utilize games to increase OpenStreetMap involvement, but I&#8217;m not sure what the best way to do that would be. The major question that came out of the games session however was, how do you make monantize it?</p>

<p>After the breakout session we had lightening talks. Those were kind of a blur for me, but the one I most enjoyed was Chris Helm&#8217;s about CouchDB. It was interesting to see someone else wanting to attempt to use it for geo. A great partical demo was an AR talk that one of the local police department is using and was a great crowd pleaser. As well as a demo of SilverLight 3 and utilizing it to display lidar data mixed and mashed for a bunch of different view points.</p>

<p>After lunch there were more plenary talks. PlanetEarth gave a demo and their interface for adding POI data looked very smart.</p>

<p>The afternoon breakout sessions I attended where about <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>
and €œOpen Data Standards.€ The OSM discussion lead to how to get more people to participate. I didn&#8217;t realize that the <a href="http://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/talk-us">US-Talk OSM mailing list</a> was low enough volume that we should post regarding <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mappingdc">MappingDC</a> events there. Day two of WhereCamp5280 will likely have a session on how to use Potlatch to contribute to OSM. Discussing €œOpen Data Standards€ was an okay discussion, but I sometimes feel tha the barriers to sharing data are so much lower than they were a decade ago that standards is not the most pressing issue. I think my opinions on that might be a whole other blog post in itself.</p>

<p>Following the sessions there was a great social event at Peter Batty&#8217;s place. It included interesting geonerd discussions which quotes such as €œif anyone tells you that Map/Reduce sucks you should punch them in the face.€ I love passionate nerd talk like that. Later into the night things turned to €œKaroke Revolution,€ which everyone participating. Hopefully the video from that is never released.</p>

<p>All and all day one of WhereCamp5280 was both fun and educational. It is always great to see what other people are doing and think as well as get to talk to them about it.</p>

 <div class="entry-content"><p>So this week I&#8217;m off to <a href="http://www.wherecamp5280.org/">WhereCamp5280</a>.  In honor of this I forked Andrew Turner&#8217;s &#8221;<a href="http://github.com/ajturner/atwhere">Am I at Where?</a>&#8221; github repository and made a <a href="http://github.com/wonderchook/atwhere">new repo</a> specifically for WhereCamp5280.</p>

<p>You can play with the results <a href="http://www.maploser.com/at5280/">here</a>.  This was my first time playing around with my iPhone and its in browser geo-location capabilities.  I really should use this for an legitimate application rather than a geonerd meme.  I have a couple ideas floating around and will try to implement one soon.</p>
