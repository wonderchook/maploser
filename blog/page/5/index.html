 <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the projects I contribute to is the OpenStreetMap project.  OSM is similar to Wikipedia but is for geographic data, it is editable by anyone and can be used with attribution by anyone.  One of the ways that people are introduced to OpenStreetMap is through mapping parties and I am helping organize one on June 20th in Washington D.C.</p>

<p>The event will start at 9 a.m. And wrap up around 4 p.m.  Feel free to stop by at anytime, some people will stay all day but it isn&#8217;t required.  We are meeting at <a href="http://www.hacdc.org/">HacDC</a> (1525 Newton St NW, Washington DC 20010)  Russ Nelson from <a href="http://www.cloudmade.com">CloudMade</a> will be there and give some background on the project as well as provide GPS units so you can collect data.  Everyone will go off and map and return to learn how to edit and upload data.  We also will be trying out <a href="http://walking-papers.org/">Walking Papers </a> which allows you to print out a map displaying OSM data and bring it with you into the field.  The idea being then that you mark-up the map and when you come back the map is scanned and can be overlayed for digitzing in Potlatch an OpenStreetMap online editor.  A printer and scanner will be provided for those that want to try this approach.</p>

 <div class="entry-content"><p>So one of the topics that was prevelant at Where 2.0 and WhereCamp last week was how to get more people mapping for <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>.  I&#8217;ve been thinking about this topic quite a bit lately and my conclusion is some healthy competition might keep people interested.  Introducting competition has the potential to encourage people to map, but potentially could introduce problems.  The first question that comes to mind for me is will people try to cheat?</p>

<p>If you google €œ<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=cheating+games&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">cheating games</a>€ many of the top searches are cheat codes for video games.  <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10797_3-10226485-235.html">Online games frequently have problems with people cheating  one of the incentives is actual money can be made in online games such as Second Life and World of Warcraft</a>.  Hopefully people would not try to cheat for OpenStreetMap glory, but some people do have an extremely competitive nature.  If prizes other than bragging rights were available then verification of the data would be even more vital.</p>

<p>I think the simplest competition would be to rank people based on distance of GPS traces a contributer uploads.  People would earn badges based on the distances.  Originally I thought about naming the badges after famous geographers, but I think that is too abstract for contributers to OpenStreetMap.  Since contributers are not necessarily from the geospatial field that convention did not necessarily seem appropriate.  I think the best badges would be based on distance and actual uploads.</p>

<p>Below is my proposed badge system:</p>

<p>-Track upload badges</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&lt; 1 km €œWent to the store€</p></li>
<li><p>1-20 km €œTrip to moms€</p></li>
<li><p>200 km €œWeekend get away€</p></li>
<li><p>320 km €œNew York to Boston€</p></li>
<li><p>1100 km €œLondon to Berlin€</p></li>
<li><p>5847 km €œParis to New York€</p></li>
<li><p>40000 km €œAround the world€</p></li>
</ul>


<p>-Contribution Badges</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1 upload €œnew mapper€</p></li>
<li><p>10 uploads €œoccasional mapper€</p></li>
<li><p>100 uploads €œcontributing mapper€</p></li>
<li><p>1000 uploads €œserious mapper</p></li>
<li><p>10000 uploads €œmap loser€</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The above system is just a start, I think that my samples are not enough to encourage people to contribute, since some of the difficult badges could potentially take a lifetime to earn.  Also the 10,000 contribution level would not need to be named after my blog.  I think a combination of incremental easy to earn badges and difficult ones is ideal.  Digital badges could be created for people to display in their blogs and social networking pages.  It would encourage people to advertise for the OpenStreetMap project and hopefully encourage people to continue to contribute.  I plan to flesh out a potential tagged feature system in coming weeks in another entry.</p>

 <div class="entry-content"><p>At the Baltimore <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> Mapping party Russ from CloudMade showed us a small GPS the Columbus v900. <a href="http://community.cloudmade.com/blog/2009/03/16/columbus-v-900-review/">Here</a> is a link to his review of the device.   I had been using my iPhone to contribute to OSM, but found it problematic if I need to do something else with my phone while I was mapping.  I ordered the v900, liking the low price and the many features. Up until this point I&#8217;ve mostly used the way point feature, but intended to eventually hook it up to my laptop.</p>

<p>Hooking the device up to my laptop running OSX was relatively easy. To make things work you need to download <a href="http://www.grandhighwizard.net/gps2gex.html">gps2ge</a> and <a href="http://www.grandhighwizard.net/gpsdx.html">GPSd</a>. GPSd is an easy dmg install, you just have to follow the typical wizard install instructions. Gps2ge is a tar file and to get it working you just have to unpack it and drag the file into your applications folder.</p>

<p>The next step is to connect the GPS unit to your computer through Bluetooth. Go to the Bluetooth setting under €œHardware€ in your System Preferences. Make sure the unit&#8217;s blue light is flashing if the unit is already on but the light is not flashing press the power button on the top of the device quickly. It should beep and the blue light should begin flashing.  In the Bluetooth menu select €œSet Up New Device&#8230;€ which will launch the Bluetooth Setup Assistant. Press continue and the next screen should ask you to €œSelect Device Type€ choose €œAny Device€ and it will begin searching for devices. I device called €œColumbus GPS€ should appear in the menu you, select it and press continue. Your computer will now collect information about the device when it is done press €œContinue.€ On the next screen it will ask for a passkey which is €œ0000€ at the time of this entry. Enter the passkey and press €œContinue€ this should complete your pairing and you can press €œQuit€ to leave the €œBluetooth Setup Assistant.€</p>

<p>To test out the connection launch €œgps2ge€ and press €œStart gps2ge.€ You should begin seeing coordinates in the application window.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_112&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;456&#8221; caption=&#8221;This is how the gps2ge displays the coordinates it is collecting. &#8220;]<img src="http://www.maploser.com/uploads/2009/05/gps2ge.jpg" alt="This is how the gps2ge displays the coordinates it is collecting. " />[/caption]</p>

<p>By default gps2ge saves its files in your tmp directory if you wish to save them somewhere else you just press the €œSettings€ button and then select €œFiles€ and you can browse to another directory.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_113&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;461&#8221; caption=&#8221;File Settings screen of gps2ge&#8221;]<img src="http://www.maploser.com/uploads/2009/05/gpssettings.jpg" alt="File Settings screen of gps2ge" />[/caption]</p>

<p>When you switch directories a Start/Stop of the tracking is required, but gps2ge will do it automatically. By default it creates 4 files gps.kml, track.kml, pos.kml, track.txt. If you want to view your current position open the GPS.kml file. I used Google Earth to view my position for real time tracking you need Google Earth Pro, but if you were to select refresh on the GPS.kml file in Google Earth it will show your latest position. Repeatedly hitting refresh would be annoying for real-time navigation but just to test out the v900 it works.</p>

<p>This is the first GPS I&#8217;ve used with a laptop since my days as a GPS Technician.  It was relatively straight forward to set-up and to start mapping.  I will do a more in depth review at some point after I&#8217;ve experimented with all the features.</p>

 <div class="entry-content"><p>Today Google opened up the <a href="http://www.google.com/latitude/apps/badge">Latitude</a> feed so you can get your Latitude location in a KML or JSON feed.  I have been working on a longer term project to create a Twitter updater service but to play with the Latitude feed I wrote a quick Ruby script.  With the json and twitter gems it was barely any work at all.  </p>

<p>The steps are essentially grab your Latitude info in JSON, extract out the latitude and longitude, authenticate with Twitter and then update your location in your profile.  The magic code is below.   To make it work with your Twitter and Latitude accounts just substitute your Latitude feed URL and insert your Twitter username/password pair.  You can look-up the appropriate URL <a href="http://www.google.com/latitude/apps/badge">here</a>.</p>

<p>For the time being I&#8217;m just going to run a cron job on my desktop but eventually I will set-up a service where people can register to have their profiles updated.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll just stick to Latitude, I&#8217;d like to use some other services as well.</p>

<pre><code>require 'net/http'
require 'uri'
require 'rubygems'
require 'json'
require 'twitter'

url = URI.parse('http://www.google.com')
 latloc = Net::HTTP.start(url.host, url.port) {|http|
 http.get('/latitude/apps/badge/api?user=youruserid&amp;type=json')
}
data = latloc.body
json = JSON.parse(data)
feature = json['features'][0]['geometry']['coordinates']
where =  feature[1].to_s &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; feature[0].to_s
httpauth = Twitter::HTTPAuth.new('username', 'password')
base = Twitter::Base.new(httpauth)
base.update_profile('location=' + where)
</code></pre>

 <div class="entry-content"><p>As I got into my car today I began to input my friend&#8217;s address so GPS and Google Maps could guide me there.  I&#8217;ve been to this individual&#8217;s house countless times and really should know how to get there.  I decided I was going to navigate there without the GPS and if I got lost I could always look it up.</p>

<p>While driving without the GPS I started to think about if using navigation tools all the times actually makes it harder for us to navigate without them.  Personally I have no sense of direction, if I don&#8217;t look at a map of an area I never form a mental map.  Unfortunately that means there are many situations where I can get from Point A to Point B to Point C, but if need to go from Point A to Point C there is no hope.  I&#8217;ve lived in the Northern Virginia area for the better part of 18 years and worked as a cartographer/GIS Programmer/GPS Technician for a roughly 8 years of it.  I figured I have a fairly good mental map.  To test this I decided to make a hand drawn map of my location.  Drawing a map of my area was inspired by the <a href="http://www.handmaps.org/">Hand Drawn Map Association</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty impressed with my maps, but there are definitely some flaws due to the unerasable nature of markers. I realize it would be difficult for most people other than myself to point out these flaws.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I misspelled Manassas originally which I corrected but in a somewhat messy way</p></li>
<li><p>My sister actually lives south of the Pentagon not North of it</p></li>
<li><p>There is an extraneous street I made up in Sterling that doesn&#8217;t exist but I wish it did, getting around would be easier</p></li>
<li><p>Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church are sort of mushed together in a weird way</p></li>
<li><p>I ran out of room in general I plan to make a wall map next time to give me more time to draw</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Anyway enough talk of me hand drawing my map here it is:</p>

 <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was on my quest to find <a href="http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/usgspubs/pp/pp1395">Map Projections: A Working Manual</a> I felt lucky to find a copy of it in my coworker&#8217;s office.  A month later I discovered another coworker also had a copy of it.  Now I have discovered it is available online from the USGS in PDF.  Unfortunately it appears to be a scanned of a copy of the book from 1987 and not searchable, but this is far better than not having access to the book at all.  </p>

<p>So if you wish to follow along with my previous post about converting <a href="http://www.maploser.com/?p=56">coordinates to Miller</a> you can easily by downloading the reference materials from the USGS.</p>

 <div class="entry-content"><p>This week the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-geocoding-errors5-2009apr05,1,6184660.story">L.A. Times reported</a> a geocoding glitch that displayed crimes that could not be mapped defaulting close to city hall. To GIS industry folks something like this happening may not be a surprise.  According to Wikipedia &#8221;<strong>Geocoding</strong> is the process of finding associated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinates">geographic coordinates</a> (often expressed as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude">latitude</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude">longitude</a>) from other geographic data, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_address">street addresses</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_codes">zip codes</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_codes">postal codes</a>). &#8220;  To take that to a more generic level you could really say &#8220;earth&#8221; and put a dot on a map and call that geocoding.  Whenever data is placed on a map a certain level of skepticism is required.</p>

<p>Though it is true that placing data accurately on a map is an import part of GIS, but I think there is an equally as important aspect.  That aspect is if the application is not going to provide only street level geocoding or better then the application needs to notify the user.  I entered €œ123 Somewhere that I made up Los Angeles, 90001€ into multiple online mapping application and records the results.
<a href="http://maps.live.com">
Virtual Earth</a> defaults this address to ZIP code centroid and does state €œThis was not an exact match for your location. €œ  Though it does not specify how it is coded.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.maploser.com/uploads/2009/04/picture-2.png" alt="Virtual Earth geocode result." /></p>

<p><a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> states it was unable to locate the address and asks if you would like a map of that ZIP code.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.maploser.com/uploads/2009/04/picture-5.png" alt="Google Maps" /><a href="http://maps.yahoo.com"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://maps.yahoo.com">Yahoo Maps</a> offers up €œFirestone Park, CA 90001€ instead.
<img src="http://www.maploser.com/uploads/2009/04/picture-6.png" alt="Yahoo Maps" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.mapquest.com">MapQuest</a> states €œWe did not find an exact match for your search, but we found a similar location.€</p>

<p><img src="http://www.maploser.com/uploads/2009/04/picture-7.png" alt="MapQuest" /></p>

<p>Even <a href="http://mappoint.msn.com">MapPoint</a> with its Web 1.0 interface states it could only find €œthe following close match.€</p>

<p><img src="http://www.maploser.com/uploads/2009/04/picture-9.png" alt="MapPoint" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.maps.com/AddressFinderNow.aspx">Maps.com</a> just zooms to the ZIP centroid and only gives a suggestion that it did not geocode to address when moused over, which would be unfortunate if one utilized their site for driving directions.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.maploser.com/uploads/2009/04/picture-11.png" alt="Maps" /></p>

<p><a href="http://yellowpages.superpages.com/directions.jsp">Superpages </a>defaults to ZIP centroid and it does only list the ZIP code in the address box, but unfortunately I don&#8217;t think that is clear enough to the user that an essentially an error occurred by the address not being matched.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.maploser.com/uploads/2009/04/picture-10.png" alt="Yellow Pages" /></p>

<p>Yellowpages just changes the address text box to the ZIP code, zooms to the centroid and gives no indication of a problem.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.maploser.com/uploads/2009/04/picture-12.png" alt="Yellowpages" /></p>

<p>To build a trust worthy mapping site there are two aspects, the first is utilizing the most accurate geocoding methodology possible, second is notifying the user of how the location was determined.  Without indicating an error the user is not giving a chance to correct the address or determine they can not place a location accurately enough.</p>

 <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m making an effort to go to more events lately, below are MapLoser approved events I have attended or will attend.</p>

<p>This past week in addition to the OSM Baltimore Mapping party I also attended <a href="http://socialmatchbox.com/wp/">Social Matchbox DC,</a> which is a start-up entrepreneur type of event.  When ever I&#8217;m around start-up types all I can think is &#8220;I need an idea I can be that passionate about.&#8221;  Of course sometimes to others it might appear as unbridled enthusiasm but if you don&#8217;t believe in your idea who else is going to?</p>

<p>As far as the future I&#8217;m signed up for all sorts of events.  The one closest on the calender is <a href="http://barcamp.org/eDemocracyCamp2">eDemocracyCamp2</a> on April 19.  I have never attended an unconference so I&#8217;m pretty excited about this one.  E-democracy interests me as a citizen more than anything else, I can see mapping being useful to the process and hope I can be of help.</p>

<p>Later on in the week I&#8217;m attending <a href="http://www.jsconf2009.com/">JSConf 2009</a> which some might say I&#8217;m abnormally excited about.  JavaScript never really excited me until I started using JQuery and now it has become one of my favorite tasks at work.  I&#8217;m hoping to build a better JavaScript game soon and since the creator of <a href="http://gamequery.onaluf.org/">gameQuery</a> is going to be there (correction: Selim Arsever will not be there but a gameQuery based <a href="http://www.harryguillermo.com/games/pacman/pacman.php">Pacman</a> game made by Harry Guillermo will be demo&#8217;d) , maybe I&#8217;ll get some ideas.  I&#8217;m really hoping that the secret topic involves the Processing port to JavaScript, but that is probably a long shot.</p>

<p>Later in April brings <a href="http://www.safe.com/support/training/trainingcalendar.php">Safe Software&#8217;s FME training</a> to Washington D.C. again.  I will not be attending, but hopefully some coworkers will be.  Personally I fly the FME flag high, especially after attending a training session.  It helps you realize how robust their ETL tool is and in my case that I didn&#8217;t need to be programming using FMEObjects to do certain tasks WorkBench already did.</p>

<p>My first event in May is on the 2nd, <a href="http://www.bootstrapmaryland.com/">Bootstrap Maryland</a>.  I have an assortment of business ideas and I&#8217;m hoping attending something like this will assist me in solidifying them into one that could work.  &#8221;I like iPhones, maps and Twitter,&#8221; is just not a business plan.  Nor does it mean that my best ideas have anything to do with that as well.  Key I think is finding something to be passionate about.</p>

<p>On May 14th I&#8217;m attending  <a href="http://ignite-dc.com/">Ignite DC</a>.  The basis of Ignite is there are 16 speakers and each is given five minutes to talk with 20 slides that automatically change.  People speak on many varied topics relating to art, technology, business, etc&#8230;  I&#8217;ve only watched videos online of previous Ignite events, but I did submit a proposal to speak.  If it does get voted to be presented I&#8217;m going to have to practice imagining everyone in their underwear.  That and staying on topic as the slides keep whizzing by.</p>

<p>The following week I&#8217;m off to San Jose, California for <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/where2009/">Where 2.0</a> and WhereCamp.  It was difficult to decide what workshops I wanted to attend at Where 2.0.</p>

<p>The workshops I decided on are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>GeoServer, GEOWebCache + OpenLayers</p></li>
<li><p>Spatial Database Tips and Tricks</p></li>
<li><p>Everything&#8217;s Moving: Displaying Dynamic GeoData with Processing</p></li>
<li><p>Stats on a Map: Spatial R</p></li>
<li><p>Building Location-Aware Apps on the iPhone &amp; Android</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Following Where 2.0 is <a href="http://wherecamp.pbwiki.com/WhereCamp2009">WhereCamp</a> but all the details aren&#8217;t entirely worked out yet.  I&#8217;m going to wait a big longer on purchasing my flight so I don&#8217;t miss any of it.</p>

<p>I am already signed up for a couple events in June and July, but I&#8217;ll update about those in another post.</p>

 <div class="entry-content"><p> Today I attended an <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> party organized by <a href="http://www.cloudmade.com">CloudMade</a>. I had previously contributed to OSM some, but I had never attended a mapping party. It was great to meet other people who were interested as well as learn a little bit better how to use <a href="http://josm.openstreetmap.de/">JOSM</a> to edit. Previously I had primarily utilized OpenStreetMap&#8217;s web interface for editing, but JOSM seems to be the way to go. It was much faster to edit locally rather than through the web, which isn&#8217;t a surprise. Previously I hadn&#8217;t liked JOSM, but I just didn&#8217;t have the workflow down.</p>

<p>During my data collection I worked with a math teacher from the Baltimore area. It was good to work with someone who was local because I would have had a hard time knowing where to start. We were a great team, because she was familiar with the area and I was familiar with the use of GPS.

<p> </p>

<p>We started out at the Stieff Silver building and walked around the nearby neighborhood. I don&#8217;t feel like I have a great system down yet, but I was able to collect some data. We ended up making a couple corrections to some streets and to add information for some points of interest. One area we came to I still don&#8217;t feel like I have figured out all the way. There was a street sign that had Chestnut Ave and Field Street on it, but there was an arrow over Field Street pointing up a grassy hill. I believe the dirt road at the top was Field Street, because there appears to be houses addressed to it but I&#8217;m still not absolutely sure. I&#8217;m going to compare some aerial photography to the GPS trace and see if it provides some insight. If you look in the center of the below photo the grassy area in the center is where the Field St sign appears to be pointing, very confusing.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Overall the OSM mapping party was my favorite event I&#8217;ve been to in a while. It is great to meet different people and get to do something I love to do, map!   I believe I&#8217;m going to get a GPS with a voice recorder, that seems to be the easiest way to handle things.</p>

 <div class="entry-content"><p>Where I work we frequently use bounding boxes to add maps to reports. Originally all of our base information was in Latitude/Longitude, this didn&#8217;t provide a very pleasing map. At some point an effort was made to switch everything to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_cylindrical_projection">Miller Projection</a>, which is a modification of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection">Mercator Projection</a> . The flaw being that it appears to me that almost nobody uses the Miller projection. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb259689.aspx">Virtual Earth</a> and Google Maps for example use Mercator.</p>

<p>At one point I ran into the issue that I needed to pass a bounding box to a map being displayed in Miller. We have bounding boxes for our commonly used polygon types stored in a generalized format for quick access. Rather than also store Miller Coordinates I decided to create a function to convert. Little did I know figuring out how to convert would be so difficult. After extensive googling the advice that made the most sense said find €œMap Projections a Working Manual€ which is U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1395 by Snyder, it was published in 1987. I was fortunate that a coworker had a copy of it.</p>

<p>In the working manual 6 whole pages are dedicated to Miller, which is at least significantly more than the Wikipedia entry. I personally have never been that great at math so I quickly turned to the numeric examples in Appendix A on pages 287-288.</p>

<p>The first part that is important is the givens:</p>

<p>-Radius of sphere
-Central meridian
-Point: (in Lat/Long)</p>

<p>The hardest part from here was translating everything into C#. Which I have shown below. I have included my bounding box class just for clarity.</p>

<pre><code>public BBox ConvertBoxToMiller(BBox box)
 {
  BBox MillerBox = new BBox();
  int radius = 6378140;
  MillerBox.maxLon = radius * box.maxLon &amp; Math.PI/180;
  MillerBox.minLon = radius * box.minLon &amp; Math.PI/180;
  Miller.maxLat = radius * Math.Log(Math.Tan(45/57.2957795 + .4 * box.maxLat/57/2957795))/.8;
  Miller.minLat = radius * Math.Log(Math.Tan(45/57.2957795 + .4 * box.minLat/57/2957795))/.8;
  return MillerBox;
 }

public class BBox
{
double minLat;
double minLon;
double maxLat;
double maxLon;
public double minLat{
 get
 {
 return minLat;
 }
 set
 {
 minLat = value;

 }
}
public double maxLat{
 get
 {
 return maxLat;
 }
 set
 {
 maxLat = value;

 }
}
public double minLon{
 get
 {
 return minLon;
 }
 set
 {
 minLon = value;

 }
}
public double maxLon{
 get
 {
 return maxLon;
 }
 set
 {
 maxLon = value;

 }
}
}
</code></pre>

<p> </p>

<p> Next I will show how to go the other direction. A project I ran into shortly afterwards when we needed to do some reporting on some log files.</p>
