<div class="entry-content"><p>As I <a href="http://blog.fortiusone.com/2011/02/14/our-trip-to-redlands-gis-week/">wrote about</a> in the <a href="http://fortiusone.com/">FortiusOne</a> blog, last week was <a href="http://redlandsgisweek.org/">Redlands GIS Week</a>. Â My post there concentrated more on the future of crowd-sourced geographic data in crisis response and ways to more quickly turn that data into information. Â That is something that I&#8217;ve spent quite of bit of time thinking about through my work on <a href="http://geocommons.com/">GeoCommon</a>s, as well as my work with the <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/weblog/">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a>. Â I spent so much time thinking about enabling crowd-sourcing of information and teaching people to edit in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> that something I&#8217;ve never thought much about is the stamping of data to make it authoritative. Â During a break-out group at GIS Week we were supposed to discuss &#8216;the Issues with VGI.&#8221; Â Nothing really new to me as far as issues came out of the discussion, one realization did occur was I have previously made data authoritative or authoritating it as I have started saying tongue in cheek.</p>

<p>I think part of the reason I&#8217;ve never really thought about this is that to me data is either authoritative or it is not, but that isn&#8217;t what determines how I use it. Â One of the previous jobs I had was doing data quality assurance, during that time I found many errors in that is considered authoritative data. Â Because of this previous job I have a lot of experience evaluating data. Â Everyone should do some evaluation of data before they use it, but it really depends on the type and the source how much they actually need to do. Â In thinking about this evaluation I began to think about the process of when we &#8220;qa&#8217;d&#8221; data before it was delivered to customers. Â Essentially that QA process was making dataÂ authoritative. Â What we were actually doing to create the data was not much different from the crowd-source efforts of many groups today though.</p>

<p>There was usually an expert in the field we were creating datasets for who would figure out what to be collected. Â The majority of the actual research though was done by interns or recent college grads. Â These people scoured the internet mostly, but wouldÂ occasionallyÂ call to confirm information. Â Once a new dataset was created or an old one updated it would go through a quality assurance process. Â Much of this was running automated tools to look for data that did not conform to what was expected. Â For example geocodes in the wrong state/zip, phone numbers of the wrong length and comparing the new data to old when possible. Â Then we would manually look for errors in the data. Â Once we decided information was &#8220;good enough&#8221; it would be pushed out to customers. Â This is the point where the data became &#8220;authoritative.&#8221; Â In the whole data creation process I estimate each dataset was touched between two and one hundred sets of hands. Â Two if the expert created the dataset by themselves and then one person tested it. Â One hundred if the dataset had been around through multiple updates that large groups of people worked on. Â If you compare this to the number of hands datasets from the CrisisMappers list, such as the recent mapping of polling stations in Sudan or the road data for OpenStreetMap the authoritativeÂ data hasn&#8217;t even been gone through as thoroughly as the non-authoritative data source. Â  Also if a mistake was found in the authoritative data source it would have to be updated and go through the whole quality assurance process again. Â What really is the difference between the two types of data in this case?</p>

<p>To me, really just that a company put their name on the authoritative data. Â I suppose if you are a buyer of the data you would have some recourse if there was a problem with the information. Â You could probably ask for all or some portion of your money back, if things went really wrong you could sue. Â Though in my examples I believe the crowd-sourced information had been more reviewed, so perhaps the chance of having issue with it is less. I realize this comparison does not work in the case of all datasets, though it is something to think about when discrediting crowd-sourced data. From where did your authoritative data come?</p>
