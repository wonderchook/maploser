<div class="entry-content"><p>This week is the first expert meeting regarding Space Based Technology and Crowd-Sourcing being hosted by UN-SPIDER.  I am not attending, but from the Twitter stream (#spidercrowd) it appears there has been a lively discussion on using satellite information and crowd-sourcing for disaster response.  What I believe is often missing from these types of conversations is preparedness.  Maybe it is presumptuous of me to discuss preparedness when imagery isn&#8217;t available freely every time for every disaster.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m typing this email from Padang, Indonesia in Western Sumatra.  Yesterday I hosted a workshop at the <a href="http://www.unand.ac.id/">University of Andalas</a> to teach them about OpenStreetMap as part of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team&#8217;s project in Indonesia.  This is the fifth workshop I&#8217;ve done at a University in Indonesia. Things went well, much like all of the other workshops I&#8217;ve given.  Students were excited and picked up the tools very quickly.  The one difference?  Available imagery.</p>

<p>This region of Indonesia is especially vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis, the last major earthquake in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Sumatra_earthquakes">Padang was in 2009</a>.  In preparing for this workshop series I investigated each area we were going to be working to check for available imagery.  For those not familiar OpenStreetMap is allowed to use Bing&#8217;s imagery to trace information, this is one of the major sources of imagery for OpenStreetMap.  In checking I looked at Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta and Surabaya.  All four of these cities had really night, half-meter or so imagery.  In Padang?  It appears to just be Landsat.  I think this highlights the need for imagery to be available beforehand though.  If something major happened here I think it is likely imagery would become freely available.  Though creating a detailed map through crowd-sourcing?  That would take a week or two and be a huge effort from people that don&#8217;t know the area as well as locals.  So why not map ahead of time?  Imagine the power if after an event the map just had to be updated, instead of created?</p>

<p>There are many different ways imagery could be made available.  Providers could donate it, I&#8217;m not asking for the shot the day before, fancy brand new imagery.  What about imagery that is a year old or so?  People purchasing imagery are usually looking for something more recent, the older stuff isn&#8217;t as valuable.  An imagery fund could be created for preparedness.  What about doing a highschool style fundraiser where everyone purchases and adopts a square kilometer?  When purchasing imagery those doing the purchasing could negotiate for better terms on it.  For example sometimes you can add additional licensees without increasing the cost.  What if everyone purchasing imagery at least asked if they could license the imagery also for OpenStreetMap to use to trace vectors?  Or an even more liberal license if possible.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m interested to hear what others think about this and if there are other ideas.  Also don&#8217;t worry specifically about HOT&#8217;s project in Padang, we were fortunate to be able to purchase imagery.  As I suggested about licensing above, we also made sure to extend the license to the government and our partners.</p>
