<div class="entry-content"><p>When I heard DevelopmentSeed put in a proposal for the Knight News Challenge to make <a href="http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/19450699629/new-contribution-tools-for-openstreetmap">simple contribution tools for OpenStreetMap</a> I was elated. I&#8217;ve long admired DevSeed for their beautiful maps and innovative uses of new technology. Â They are already well involved in OpenStreetMap through support of Mapnik, attendance at development sprints and use of OpenStreetMap information in MapBox. I think there is a real opportunity here to improve the ability of average people to contribute to and utilize OpenStreetMap. Â What is the key? Â Make the tools simple and the cycle to use the data just as easy as contributing.</p>

<p>The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team probably spends more time than any other group in OpenStreetMap teaching the technology to non-technical users. Our work in Haiti and Indonesia has been with local people who are not programmers, nor GIS analysts. It can be a real struggle to ensure people can both enter data easily as well as utilize the information they have input. There are many great tools that help with this process, but it is far from smooth. Let&#8217;s look at the entire OpenStreetMap contribution cycle.</p>

<h2>Gathering Data</h2>

<p>I would say collecting data in the field is probably the easiest part of OpenStreetMap. Â GPS units are relatively easy to use for example. Â The menus on the Garmin Etrex units that HOT usually use do have some odd menus, but for the most part people are just pushing the button to mark a way point. Â Though if I take a break from collecting data for a couple weeks I can never seem to find the menu item to delete those way points. Â This problem is not too difficult though and most people get used to the workflow.</p>

<p>Walking Papers by far is the biggest improvement in field data collection in years. Â My first job in mapping was creating field maps for mosquito control technicians. Â If I had Walking Papers back then it would have been magical. I was constantly getting paper maps back with corrections on them, it is just natural for people to draw on maps to denote new features. I think in data collection OpenStreetMap is in a good place, the real areas for improvement are editing and data usage.</p>

<h2>Entering Data</h2>

<p>I mean no slight to the developers of OpenStreetMap editing tools with my critique here. Potlatch2 and JOSM are both tools that I frequently use, but I am a programmer with a Geography Degree. Â How many people with my background are there on earth? Â By percentage probably not many.</p>

<p>The biggest flaw with either of these tools is they try to allow you to do everything. Â Most people however don&#8217;t need to do everything. In an average workshop that I lead key goals are to map roads, add some points of interest and map houses. We never touch relations, I don&#8217;t explain what a changeset is and someone help us if there is a conflict (which there always is). Â Usually we are using JOSM, Potlatch2 has come a long way in helping make the data entry process easier. Â Dragging icons over to the map to add them is far more natural than drawing an object and then clicking through a menu to define it as is done in JOSM.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.maploser.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Selection_012.png"><img src="http://www.maploser.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Selection_012-152x300.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Though the simple and advanced mode in Potlatch2 is a bit confusing and if you want to get the history of an item it is hard to find the right button. For example on the left is the advanced screen, can you guess where you would click to get the history of the selected item? Did you guess 30176850? Probably not. I think it is fair to say that looking at the object history is an advanced task, I don&#8217;t often go over it in the first workshop unless the hands on portion leads us there. Â I don&#8217;t think however that it is obvious to click on the unique identifier to go to that page.</p>

<p>One other minor complaint would be that some of the buttons &#8220;look more button like.&#8221; It isn&#8217;t completely clear here to tab between the Simple and Advanced screens for example and to delete a tag you click on an &#8220;x&#8221; button but to add you click on the word &#8220;Add.&#8221; Using icons would make this more usable for those that don&#8217;t have a version of Potlatch2 translated into their native language.</p>

<p>Overall I really like how Potlatch2 has made editing much more simple. Â If it worked offline we would consider teaching it instead of JOSM to beginners. It is a huge improvement over Potlatch2 and the team developing it has much to be proud. I think however there are ways to get even more simple.</p>

<h2>Using Data</h2>

<p>The biggest gap in OpenStreetMap is using the data. HOT has attempted to bridge that by teachingÂ <a href="http://qgis.org/">QuantumÂ GIS</a>, which has made huge strides in the past year in becoming an easy to use complete Desktop GIS. Â That is just it though, you shouldn&#8217;t have to use Desktop GIS just to make a map. <a href="http://mapbox.com">MapBox</a> has greatly improved the accessibility of making web maps, but sometimes you just want to print. Speeding up the cycle of data usage would also assist. Â The most frequent way we suggest people access the data is to download it from <a href="http://download.geofabrik.de/">GeoFabrik</a>, which is a great free service. The only thing lacking is speed, there is great joy in adding information and seeing it show up on the OpenStreetMap website virtually instantly, but some disappointment when you have to wait a day to be able to use it in specifically the way you want. There are ways to get around this, but they do require someone technical to set them up.</p>

<h2>Simple Language</h2>

<p>Normally when I post publicly about OpenStreetMap I make it a point to try to avoid the language of OpenStreetMap. It is a language people can use but is not immediately accessible to most people. My favorite example of obscure language in tools is when my interns <a href="http://whateverisaid.wordpress.com/">Emir Hartato</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/justva">Vasanthi</a> were translating JOSM into Bahasa Indonesia and got to &#8220;OrthogonalizeÂ Shape.&#8221; Think about it, does the average person know what that means? Â What about using language like straighten corners or something? By the way &#8220;Orthogonalize Shape&#8221; is &#8220;Ortogonalisasi Bentuk&#8221; in Bahasa Indonesia in case you were wondering.</p>

<h2>What Do I Want?</h2>

<p>So far I&#8217;ve pointed on flaws in OpenStreetMap, but what is my point? What do I really want? Â Simple tools and simple language for the average person. If a person fluent in two languages has to stop and really think about how to translate something, then it is probably too complicated. Let&#8217;s concentrate on making work flows for the 90% of use cases that utilize the 10% of existing functionality, not try to cover every piece of possible functionality.</p>

<p>Rather than thinking about tasks by functions let&#8217;s think about them by themes. Â Groups that are interested in mapping for disaster preparedness, groups that want to map the green spaces in their community, people that want to share a great hiking route with everyone. Â In starting with the use-cases the needed functionality will become obvious.</p>

<p>More than anything, let&#8217;s make sure when someone puts data in they can use it. Â Easily, without a struggle.</p>
