<div class="entry-content"><p>I have discussed the need for <a href="http://www.maploser.com/2011/07/06/imagery-pre-disaster-lets-do-better/">access to satellite information</a> for <a href="http://www.maploser.com/2010/11/16/openstreetmap-and-crisis-response-why-it-is-sometimes-about-the-license/">crisis response often</a>. When there is a large scale disaster imagery tends to become available relatively quickly, but in cases of smaller events or mapping for preparedness this is not always the case. In my work in Indonesia over the past year we have been fortunate to be able to purchase imagery of <a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/job/9">Padang City</a> (OpenStreetMap login required) and additionally Microsoft has updated much of the imagery available through Bing Maps. This access has been enabled by the purchasing power of large organizations, AusAID and Microsoft respectively. Work continues to use similarly sized organizations to increase access in other areas, but the process is slow and there is no guarantee imagery will be available everywhere, every time. Yet. Currently the digitization of the imagery is performed by the crowd, what about enabling them to assist in the purchase?</p>

<h2>Lack of Physical or Financial Access</h2>

<p>The<a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/"> Public Laboratory for Open Science and Technology</a> (PLOTS) has done much to enable the crowd-sourcing of inexpensive imagery. Unfortunately many times when crisis mapping occurs access to collect this type of imagery is impossible or extremely dangerous. Imagine flying a balloon in Syria today in order to collect information, the risks would be suicidal.  In other cases the physical terrain of the area may make it very difficult to access, but a small group may not have the financial means to purchase imagery by other means.</p>

<h2>Enabling Collective Purchasing Power</h2>

<p>Currently the <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a> utilizes a tool the <a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/">Tasking Manager</a> to coordinate digitization and verification of imagery analysis. What if this tool could also be utilized to feed into the purchase process of imagery. Individuals could choose to adopt squares and volunteer to pay for them, this would be an all or nothing proposition, if all the squares were pledge the project would go forward, otherwise it would not. This crowd-funding model would be very similar to <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>, but perhaps instead of rewards pledgers could adopt squares to digitize once the imagery was purchased.</p>

<p><a href=" http://maploser.com/images/old-ml/2012/03/padang_sized.png"><img src=" http://maploser.com/images/old-ml/2012/03/padang_sized.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The image above is the overview map from the Tasking Manager of the task for Padang City.  It gives a quick overview of Total number of jobs, how many jobs are done, how many are validated and how many are currently being worked on.  What if there was an overview of squares that were funded?  The same as when someone takes a job to complete they could either select a random job or a specific one by clicking on the map.  The entire community would be able to see quickly if an area was near being available for purchase.</p>

<p>In Kickstarter it is possible for projects to collect more than they ask for initially.  If people were adopting specific squares I don&#8217;t see this being possible, but perhaps if you selected a random square they would not be assigned to the end.  That way it would be possible for more squares to be purchased than exist.  Sponsors of the imagery fundraising drive could decide on specific things that would happen in these cases (ahead of time to encourage the crowd), possible ideas would be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>purchase of GPS units to create a bank for people living in those areas</p></li>
<li><p>a HOT mission to train those locally how to map in OpenStreetMap</p></li>
<li><p>Purchase of imagery of an expanded area</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Can We Expand Access to Imagery?</h2>

<p>I will continue to advocate for expansion of access to imagery. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/schuyler">Schuyler Erle</a> has previously stated that access to imagery in times of crisis is vital almost like water for mapping in response (Schuyler sorry I couldn&#8217;t find an exact quote). I fully agree with this assessment. I will continue to work with governments and large organizations with purchasing power that can help enable the crowd to respond.  If imagery is as vital as water though, I think we also have to take matters into our own hands as pursue every avenue possible.</p>
